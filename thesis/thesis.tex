    \todo[inline]{Philipp: Yes, "see Section 3.1" is the right way to do it (normally, one capitalizes "Section"). When referring to subsections and subsubsections, I would also call them "Section", indeed, because their number already says what kind of subsection it is.}

    \section{Targeted audience}
      This thesis is targeted for \gls{web} developers that wish to gain a deeper understanding of element queries and how one could solve the problem today.
      Heavy use of \gls{web} terminology is being used and intermediate \gls{web} development knowledge is beneficial.
      For readers that are not familiar with web terminology there is a glossary at the end of the document.
      \todo[inline]{Philipp wanted this to be more general.}
    \section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem}
      By using \gls{CSS} \gls{media queries}, developers can specify different style rules for different \gls{viewport} sizes.
      This is fundamental to creating \gls{responsive} \gls{web} applications, as shown in section~\ref{sec:rwd}.
      If developers want to build modular applications by composing the application by smaller components (\glspl{element}, scripts, styles, etc.) \gls{media queries} are no longer applicable.
      \todo[color=red]{Tomas: The reader could misundestand this as modular design is about putting all scripts with scripts, styles with styles, etc.}
      Modular \gls{responsive} components should be able to react and change style depending on the size that the component has been given by the application, not the \gls{viewport} size. \todo{Do I need to have a reference for this?}
      The problem can be formulated as: \emph{It is not possible to specify conditional style rules for \glspl{element} depending on the size of an element}.
      See the included document in section~\ref{sec:problem-formulation} of the appendix for a more practical problem formulation.

      Participants, which include both paying members and the public, of the main international standards organization for the \gls{web}, the \gls{W3C} are interested in solving the problem and possible solutions are being discussed.
      However, they are still at the initial planning stage \cite{ricg_site} so a solution will not be implemented \glslink{native}{natively} in the near future.
      Additionally, implementing element queries imposes circularity and performance problems, as shown in chapter~\ref{chp:eq}, which needs to be resolved before writing a standard.
      While awaiting a \gls{native} solution it is up to the developers to implement this feature as a \gls{third-party} solution.
      \todo[color=red]{Tomas: Maybe not third-party? Third-party refers to something that has not been developer in-house. third-party here should be substituted to the negation of native.}
      As presented in chapter~\ref{ch:state-of-the-art}, efforts have been made to create a robust \gls{third-party} solution, with moderate success.
      It should be noted that no effort of implementing a native solution have been made.
      Since all current \gls{third-party} solutions have shortcomings, there is still no de facto solution that developers use and the problem remains unsolved.
      % Some problems with implementing element queries \glslink{native}{natively} in \gls{CSS} are:
      % \begin{itemize}
      %   \item \textbf{Circularity:}
      %   If style rules can be applied by criteria of other \glspl{element}, it is possible to create cyclic rules (infinite loops of styling).
      %   Some cyclic rules might be possible to detect during \gls{CSS} parsing, but there are so many combinations of style properties that could result in cyclic rules that it will add a lot of complexity to the language, both for implementers and users.
      %   \todo[color=green]{Marcos: citation}
      %   Also, it has been shown that some cyclic rules are impossible to detect at parsetime, due to being dependent on runtime factors.
      %   \todo[color=green]{Marcos: Write that this will be shown later in the report instead, or reference to that section, or something like that.}
      %   \item \textbf{Performance:} 
      %   \Gls{layout engine} vendors are interested in performing selector matching and layout computations in parallel to achieve better performance.
      %   \todo[color=green]{Marcos: citation}
      %   The research front of \glspl{browser} have shown successful ways of parallelizing the \gls{layout engine}.
      %   Element queries implies some undesired limitations to the \glspl{layout engine}.
      %   With element queries, \glspl{layout engine} need to first compute the layout of all \glspl{element} in order to decide which selectors would conform to the element query conditions and then do a new layout computation with the new style rules activated, and so on until a stable state has been reached.
      %   Far worse, since selectors would depend on layout style, style and layout computations become hard to parallelize.
      %   \todo{Same here as above.}
      % \end{itemize}
    \section{Objective}
      The main objective of this thesis is to design and develop a \gls{third-party} non-\gls{native} implementation of element queries.
      To do this, it is needed to research existing solution approaches in order to understand and analyze the advantages and shortcomings of the approaches.
      It is also necessary to be aware of the premises, such as \gls{browser} limitations and specifications that one must conform to.
      \todo[color=green]{Marcos: I will research the problems of.}
      In addition, research will be done about the problems of implementing element queries \glslink{native}{natively}, to get a deeper understanding of the potential shape of a standardized \gls{API}.
      Solving the main problem will require research and empirical studies of many subproblems.
      Examples of such subproblems that needs to be addressed are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Should circularity be handled? If yes, should it be detected at runtime or parsetime, and what should happen on detection?
        \item How can one observe \gls{element} size changes without any \gls{native} support?
        \item
          How can a custom \gls{API} be crafted that will enable element queries and still conform to the language specifications? Is it possible to create an \gls{API} that feels natural to \gls{web} developers and works in tandem with other tools and libraries?
          For instance, if the \gls{API} requires custom \gls{CSS} syntax then \gls{CSS} preprocessors, linters and validators cannot be used anymore.
          Likewise, if the \gls{API} requires a special \gls{element} handling process, it could be hard to use with popular libraries. \todo{Should I give examples like Angular React Backbone Bootstrap?}
        \item Is it possible to solve the problem with adequate performance for large applications that make heavy use of responsive modules?
        \item How can adequate \gls{browser} compatibility with legacy browsers be achieved without \gls{native} support?
      \end{itemize}
      The scientific question to be answered is if it is possible to solve the problem without extending any language specification of the \gls{web}.
      The hypothesis is that the problem can be solved with high reliability and adequate performance by developing a \gls{third-party} implementation.
      The goal of this thesis should be considered fulfilled if a solution was successfully implemented or described, or if the problems hindering a solution are thoroughly documented.
      \todo[inline,color=red]{Tomas: Remove this paragraph. Should state what have been done instead.}

    \section{Significance}
      \todo[inline,color=red]{Tomas: Maybe more general or more specific. If details have to be presented, then the reader has to be able to understand it.}
      Many libraries and techniques are being used in \gls{web} development to keep the code from becoming an entangled mess.
      Creating modules facilitates the development and increases the reusability, as shown in section~\ref{sec:modularity}.
      Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to create \gls{encapsulated} \gls{responsive} modules since conditional styles cannot be applied to \glspl{element} by \gls{element} size criterion.
      Without element queries, \gls{responsive} modules force the application to style them properly depending on the \gls{viewport} sizes, which defeats the purpose of modules.
      Modules should be \gls{encapsulated} and may not require the user to perform some of the module logic in order to work.
      Another option would be to make modules context-aware so they can style themselves according to the \gls{viewport}, but then they would not be reusable (since they assume a specific context).
      Also, changes to the application layout would then require to rewrite the \gls{media queries} of the modules to take the new layout into account.
      Clearly, no sound option exists for having \gls{responsive} modules.

      The last couple of years a lot of articles have been written about the problem and how badly \gls{web} developers need element queries \cite{eq_article_localised-css,eq_article_backalley,eq_article_mqhack,eq_article_tabatkjr,eq_article_filament,eq_article_tyson,eq_article_neal,eq_article_css-tricks,eq_article_hugo,eq_article_fremycompany,eq_article_discource,eq_article_matt}.
      As already stated in section~\ref{sec:problem}, \gls{third-party} implementation efforts have been made with moderate success.
      The \gls{W3C} receives requests and questions about it, and the \gls{RICG} have started writing a draft \cite{ricg_draft} about element queries use cases.

      Solving this problem would be a big advancement to \gls{web} development, enabling developers to create truly modular \gls{responsive} components.
      By studying the problem, identifying approaches and providing a \gls{third-party} solution the community can take a step closer to solve the problem \glslink{native}{natively}.
      If the hypothesis holds, developers will be able to use element queries in the near future, while waiting for the \gls{W3C} standardize a solution. \todo{Would like to reformulate this to not being so confident that a standard will definately be developed}
      \todo[color=red]{Tomas: The hypothesis should be valid or invalid at the time the report is handed in.}
      The outcome of this thesis can also be helpful for the \gls{W3C} and others to get an overview of the problem and possibly get ideas how subproblems can be handled.
    \section{Scope}

    \section{Outline}
      \todo[inline]{This is now totally outdated.}

      % This thesis is divided into four parts. The first part \emph{\ref{ch:background}~\nameref{ch:background}} presents some history of the \gls{web} platform and describes concepts needed to understand the problem.
      % The background part starts with the history of \glspl{browser} and information about market share between them followed by a brief history of the evolution of \gls{web} development.
      % After that, the \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design concept will be described along with why modularity is important in software development.
      % \todo[inline]{This is now invalid, since much of this has moved to the appendix.}

      % The second part \emph{\ref{part:theory}~\nameref{part:theory}} presents theoretizations of the problem.
      % It starts with describing a reference architecture of \glspl{layout engine} and the parts of \glspl{layout engine} that directly affects element queries will be described in detail.
      % Here it will also be presented why element queries impose problems to \glspl{layout engine} on a theoretical level.
      % After that, a full description of element queries as a concept and a more in depth analysis of the problems will be given.
      % Possible solutions to the given problems will also be presented followed by a fictional native \gls{API} description based on probable design decisions.

      % The third part \emph{\ref{part:library}~\nameref{part:library}} presents the design and implementation of the solution as a \gls{third-party} library.
      % Here possible approaches to solving the problem will be presented.
      % Other implementations and solutions will be described and analyzed followed by a motivation of the chosen approach for the library.
      % Identified technical requirements will be given in order to motivate the library architecture and \gls{API} design.
      % After that, interesting parts of the implementation will be presented.\todo{Maybe flesh this one out as it has been written.}

  \chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}
    \begin{metatext}
      This chapter aims to present sufficient background to understand why element queries is a desired feature and why it is hard to implement natively in browsers.
      Section~\ref{sec:web-dev} will present a brief history of web development and motivate why responsive web design and modular development are desired concepts in modern web development.
      Section~\ref{sec:layout-engines} describes briefly how layout engines operates, with focus on the layout process, to later present how they can be parallelized in section~\ref{sec:parallel}.
      \todo{Write that~\ref{sec:parallel} will be needed to understand the problems of element queries?}
      The chapter ends with section~\ref{sec:layout-thrashing} that defines layout thrashing and shows how it can be avoided.
      \todo{Write that~\ref{sec:layout-thrashing} will be extensively referenced from implementation chapter?}
      Expert readers may want to skip directly to chapter~\ref{chp:eq} where element queries is described.

    \section{Web development}\label{sec:web-dev}
      \begin{metatext}
        Browsers are the far most popular tools for accessing content on the \gls{web}, which makes them very important in the modern society.
        In the dawn of the \gls{web}, \glspl{browser} were simply applications that fetched and displayed text with embedded links.
        Today, \glspl{browser} act more like an operating system (on top of the host system) executing complex \gls{web} applications.
        There even exist computers that only run a \gls{browser}, which is sufficient for many users.
        This section will describe the transition from \glspl{browser} rendering simple \glspl{document} to being hosts for complex applications in section~\ref{sec:doc-to-app}.
        It will also describe two key evolution points in \gls{web} development --- \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design in section~\ref{sec:rwd} and modular development in section~\ref{sec:modularity}.
      \end{metatext}

      \subsection{From documents to applications}\label{sec:doc-to-app}
        \begin{metatext}
          This section will describe the transition from \glspl{browser} rendering simple \glspl{document} to being hosts for complex applications.
          Since \gls{web} development trends are not easily pinned to exact dates, this section will only present dates as guidance and should not be regarded as exact dates for the events.
          This section is a summary of \normalfont{\cite{wiki_web_dev,wiki_cgi,wiki_css,wiki_ajax,wiki_html5,book_html5}}.
        \end{metatext}

        As further described in section~\ref{sec:www} of the appendix, \glspl{browser} were initially applications that displayed \gls{hypertext} \glspl{document} with the ability to fetch linked \glspl{document} in an user friendly way.
        Static content was written in \gls{HTML}, which could include hyperlinks to other \gls{hypertext} \glspl{document} or hypermedia.
        Different stylesheet languages were being developed to enable the possibility of separating content styling with the content.
        In 1996 the \gls{W3C} officially recommended \gls{CSS}, which came to be the preferred way of styling \gls{web} content.
        Since \gls{HTML} is only a markup language it is not possible to generate dynamic content, which was sufficient at the time \gls{HTML} was only used for annotating links in research \glspl{document}.

        The need for generated dynamic content grew bigger, and the \gls{NCSA} created the first draft of the \gls{CGI} in 1993, which provides an interface between the \gls{web} server and the systems that generate content.
        \gls{CGI} programs are usually referred to as scripts, since many of the popular \gls{CGI} languages are script languages.
        Generating dynamic content on the server is sometimes referred to as \emph{server-side scripting}.
        This enabled developers to generate dynamic websites, with different content for different users for instance.
        However, when the content is delivered to the client (\gls{browser}) it is still static.
        There was no way for the server to change the content that the client has received, unless the client requests another \gls{document}.

        Around 1996, client side scripting was born.
        The term \gls{DHTML} was being used as an umbrella term for a collection of technologies used together to make pages interactive and animated, where client side scripting played a big role.
        Examples of things that were being done with \gls{DHTML} are; refreshing pages for the user so that new content is loaded, give feedback on user input without involving the server and animating content.
        Plugins also started to exist during this time that enabled \glspl{browser} to handle and execute embedded programs.
        \emph{Java applet}\footnote{A Java applet is a small application which is written in Java and delivered to users in the form of bytecode. See \url{www.java.com}} and \emph{Flash}\footnote{Flash is a multimedia and software platform for producing cross platform interactive animations. See \url{www.flash.com}} are examples of browser embedded programs requiring browser plugins to execute.
        In concept, users have to install the plugin runtime in order for the browser to be able to execute the plugin programs, which is undesired since it adds a barrier between users and the content.
        However, plugins enabled developers to access some capabilities that were lacking in browsers (e.g., video playback, programmable graphics, and interactive animations).
        Some \glspl{OS} and \glspl{browser} ships with preinstalled plugins, while others do not support plugins at all.

        With the increase of smart devices (such as phones, televisions, cars, game consoles, etc.) that includes \glspl{browser} with limited \gls{third-party} runtimes, plugins quickly decreased in popularity.
        Additionally, as the web platform was improved and users being discoraged by browsers from installing plugins due to security issues, the use of plugins decreased further.

        As \gls{JavaScript} and \gls{HTML} supported more features, websites turned into small applications with user sessions and rich \glspl{GUI}.
        Still, parts of the applications were defined as \gls{HTML} pages, fetched from the server when navigating the site.
        When the \emph{XMLHttpRequest} \gls{API} was supported in the major \glspl{browser}, pages no longer needed to reload in order to fetch new content as XMLHttpRequest enabled developers to perform asynchronous requests to servers with \gls{JavaScript}.
        This opened up for the \gls{AJAX} \gls{web} development technique which became a popular way of communicating with servers ``in the background'' of the page.
        \todo[color=green]{Marcos: Remember that AJAX is a total misnomer :) It has little to do with XML, or JS really, + many people made sync requests, as allowed by XMLHttpRequest. You could say that asynchronously fetching of data over HTTP to then dynamically update presentation was colloquially referred to as "AJAX". }
        Developers pushed \glspl{browser} and \gls{HTML} to the limit when creating applications instead of \glspl{document} that they were originally designed for.
        In a \gls{W3C} meeting in 2004 it was proposed to extend \gls{HTML} to ease the creation of \gls{web} applications, which was rejected.
        The \gls{W3C} was criticized of not listening to the need of the industry, and some members of the \gls{W3C} left to create the \gls{WHATWG}.
        The \gls{WHATWG} started working on specifications to ease the development of \gls{web} applications which came to be grouped together under the name \gls{HTML5}.
        In 2006, the \gls{W3C} acknowledged that \gls{WHATWG} were on the right track, and decided to start working on their own \gls{HTML5} specification based on the \gls{WHATWG} version.
        \gls{HTML5} is an evolutionary improvement process of \gls{HTML}, which means that \glspl{browser} are adding support as parts of the specification is finished.

        A new era of \glspl{API} and features came along with \gls{HTML5} and \gls{CSS3}, which truly enabled developers to create rich client side applications.
        With the new features developers could utilize advanced graphics programming, geolocation, local and session storage, advanced input, offline mode, and much more.

      \subsection{Responsive web design}\label{sec:rwd}
        \begin{metatext}
          A few years ago, \gls{web} developers could make assumptions about the screen size of user devices.
          Since typically only desktop computers with monitors accessed \gls{web} sites they were designed for a minimum \gls{viewport} size.
          If the size of the \gls{viewport} was smaller than the supported one, the site would look broken.
          This was a valid approach in a time when tablets and smartphones were unheard of.
          Today, another approach is needed to ensure that sites function properly across a range of different devices and \gls{viewport} sizes.
          This section is a summary of \normalfont{\cite{book_rwd,wiki_rwd,mjelde2014performance}}.
        \end{metatext}

        \todo[inline,color=green]{Marcos: Remember that developers might be also targeting actual browsers, not just "mobile" or "desktop".}
        According to \emph{\gls{StatCounter}}, 37\% of the \gls{web} users are visiting sites on a mobile or tablet device.
        No longer is it valid to not support small screens.
        Furthermore, it is understood that sites need to be styled differently if they are visited by touch devices with small screens or mouse-based devices with large screens.
        Since \gls{web} developers were not ready for this rapid change of device properties, they resorted to using the same approach that they had done before --- making assumptions about the user device based on the server request.
        When a \gls{browser} requests a resource, an \emph{\glslink{browser}{user agent} string} is usually sent with the request to identify what kind of \gls{browser} the user is using. \todo{Explain user agent, that all browsers are user agents but not the other way around.}
        By reading the \glslink{browser}{user agent} string on the server-side, a mobile-friendly version of the site could be served if the user was sending mobile \glslink{browser}{user agent} strings and the desktop version could be served otherwise.
        The mobile version would be designed for a maximum width, and the desktop would be designed for a minimum width.
        
        This was a natural reaction since no better techniques existed, but the approach has many flaws.
        First, developers now have multiple versions of a site to maintain and develop in parallel.
        Second, this approach doesn't scale well with new devices entering the market.
        \todo[color=green]{Marcos: Not only devices (also browser).}
        For instance, tablets are somewhere in the middle of mobile and laptops in size, which would require another special version of the site.
        Further, when desktops support touch actions and smartphones support mouse actions, even more versions of the website needs to be developed in order to satisfy all user devices.
        Third, the desktop site assumes that desktop users have big screens (which usually is true).
        However, there is no guarantee that the \gls{browser} \gls{viewport} will be big just because the screen is big.
        Users might want to have multiple \gls{browser} windows displayed at the same time on the screen, which would break the assumptions about the layout size available for the site.
        Clearly, a better approach was needed.

        With the release of \gls{CSS3} \gls{media queries} new possibilities opened up.
        Media queries enabled developers to write conditional style rules by media properties such as the \gls{viewport} size.
        See listing~\ref{code:mq-example} for an example of how \gls{media queries} can be used to style \glspl{element} differently with relation to the viewport size.
        This can be used to tailor a site for a specific medium or \gls{viewport} size at runtime.
        \gls{RWD} refers to the approach of having a single site being \gls{responsive} to different media properties (mainly the \gls{viewport} size) at runtime to improve the user experience.
        With \gls{RWD} it is no longer needed to maintain several versions of a site, instead the site adapts to the user medium and device.

        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,label={code:mq-example},caption={The above \gls{CSS} styles the body of the website blue if the \gls{viewport} is less or equal to 600 pixels wide, and yellow otherwise.},captionpos=b]]

            body {

      \subsection{Modularity}\label{sec:modularity}
        \begin{metatext}
          As the web was a platform for \gls{hypertext} \glspl{document} that quickly transitioned to serving complex applications, few techniques existed for writing modular code.
          The last couple of years as applications grew bigger, techniques and libraries have been developed to ease modular development.
          \todo[color=red]{Tomas: Applications did not grew bigger. Instead, they transitioned from being generated at server side, to living entirely on the client side}
          Modular development is an old concept, but somewhat newborn in the web scene.
          This section aims to describe what modular development really is, and why it is such an important success factor to software development.
          This section is partly based on \normalfont{\cite{book_modular_programming,book_eloq_js,rich_hickey}}.
        \end{metatext}

        By creating modules that can be used in any context with well-defined responsibilities and dependencies, developing applications is reduced to the task of simply configuring modules (to some extent) to work together which forms a bigger application.
        It is today possible to write the \gls{web} client logic in a modular way in \gls{JavaScript}.
        The desire of writing modular code can be shown by the popularity of libraries that helps dividing up the client code into modules.
        The ever so popular libraries \emph{Angular}, \emph{Backbone}, \emph{Ember}, \emph{Web Components}, \emph{Requirejs}, \emph{Browserify}, \emph{Polymer}, \emph{React} and many more all have in common that they embrace coding modular components.
        Many of these libraries also help with dividing the \gls{HTML} up into modules, creating small packages of style, markup and code.

        A big challenge to software development is to be able to write software that is reliable (i.e., should not have bugs) and easy to change.
        \todo[color=red]{Tomas: And to be finished in time?}
        What keeps developers from producing such software is often complexity, which hinders developers from reasoning about the software.
        The word ``complex'' can be defined as \emph{something consisting of interconnected or intertwined parts}.
        A quote from Rich Hickey:
        \begin{quote}
          So if every time I think I pull out a new part of the software I need to comprehend, and it's attached to another thing, I had to pull that other thing into my mind because I can't think about the one without the other.
          That's the nature of them being intertwined. So every intertwining is adding this burden, and the burden is kind of combinatorial as to the number of things that we can consider.
          So, fundamentally, this complexity, and by complexity I mean this braiding together of things, is going to limit our ability to understand our systems.
        \end{quote}
        By separating the software into well defined parts (i.e., modules) that has a single responsibility and ideally performs a single task, complexity can be reduced.
        Of course, splitting software up into modules alone does not help reducing complexity.
        The modules also need to be \gls{encapsulated}, which means that they work by themselved and do not require the user of the module to write its logic.
        Modules should also be loosely coupled, and may not make any assumptions about the context they will be used in.
        It is then possible to reason about them and change the functionality locally inside the boundary of a module.
        
        With modularity comes positive side effects.
        Loose coupling between modules facilitates integration testing of each module, since it is then possible to test parts of the software in isolation and independent of the system as a whole.
        Developers can also work on different parts of the software in parallel without being affected by each other, as modules are not allowed to affect each other (other than by configurable options, injected strategies or directly dependent submodules).
        \todo[color=red]{Tomas: Maybe one-way dependencies?}
        The very nature of modules not being context-aware enables them to be reused in other projects (or other parts of the same application).
        Reusability is not only important to speed up the development process of new software projects, it also eases managing a large code base.
        A single module that performs a general task is much simpler to manage than multiple modules performing the same task but being written for different contexts.
        When a bug arises, the patch would only need to be applied to one module instead of all similar modules that could possibly be affected.
        Clearly, modular development is highly desired.

        However, since modules are allowed to be nested (i.e., modules may depend on submodules that may depend on other submodules and so on) and that the logic responsibility is moved from the application to the module, the complexity of managing them is added.
        \gls{API} changes of a module can break modules that depend on them, and multiple versions of the same module must be maintained because the old versions may be used in parallel to the newer versions.
        Having a good semantic versioning convention is key to reduce the complexity of managing multiple versions of modules.

      \begin{metatext}
        Before diving into the theory of element queries, it is important to understand how \glspl{layout engine} work.
        Only the \gls{layout engine} of the \gls{browser} will be of importance, since element queries do not affect any other \gls{browser} subsystem.
        This section will give a brief explanation of the layout process that the engines generally perform, along with some usual optimizations that are performed to speed up the process.
        In section~\ref{sec:parallel} insight will be given into the current state of the research of parallelizing the layout process.
        Last, layout thrashing will be presented and how it can be avoided in section~\ref{sec:layout-thrashing}.

          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{browser_architecture,garsiel2011browsers}}.
        \end{metatext}

        Browsers are complex applications that consist of many subsystems.
        A reference architecture of \glspl{browser} has been presented by \cite{browser_architecture}, see figure~\ref{fig:browser_architecture}.

          \label{fig:browser_architecture}
        \end{figure}
        It is shown that the \gls{layout engine} is located between the \emph{\gls{browser} engine} system and the network, \gls{JavaScript}, and display backend.
        The \gls{browser} engine acts as a high level interface to the \gls{layout engine}, and is responsible for providing the \gls{layout engine} with \glspl{URL} of content that should be fetched and rendered.
        Additionally, browser engines usually provide the layout engine with layout and rendering options such as user preferred font size, zoom, etc.
        The main responsibility of the \gls{layout engine} is to render the current state of the fetched \gls{hypertext} \gls{document}.
        Since \glspl{document} may (and often do) change dynamically after parsetime it is important to keep in mind that the job of the \gls{layout engine} is continuous, and is not a one time operation.
        The \gls{layout engine} also performs the parsing of \gls{HTML}.
        In short, \glspl{layout engine} perform four distinct tasks:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Fetch content (typically \gls{HTML}, \gls{CSS} and \gls{JavaScript}) and parse it in order to construct a \gls{DOM} tree. \todo{Explain DOM before this?}
          \item Construct a \gls{render tree} of the \gls{DOM} tree.
          \item Layout the \glspl{element} of the \gls{render tree}.
          \item Render the \glspl{element} of the \gls{render tree}.
        \end{enumerate}
        See section~\ref{sec:dom-tree} and section~\ref{sec:render-tree} for a more in depth explanation of \gls{DOM} and \glspl{render tree}.
        \Glspl{browser} can typically display multiple pages at the same time (by using tabs, multiple windows or frames) where each page has an instance of the \gls{layout engine}.

        There are four \glspl{layout engine} that the major \glspl{browser} use, as presented in table~\ref{table:layout_engines}.
        Since Blink is a recent \gls{fork} of \gls{WebKit} they have been grouped together as \gls{WebKit}-based \glspl{layout engine}.
        This results in three distinct \glspl{layout engine} to consider: \gls{WebKit}, Gecko and Trident.
        Due to Trident being closed source, only the \gls{WebKit}-based \glspl{layout engine} and Gecko will be considered in this section.

      \subsection{Constructing DOM trees}\label{sec:dom-tree}
        \begin{metatext}
          Here a brief explanation of \gls{DOM} trees will be given, and how they are constructed.
          In order to construct a \gls{DOM} tree, the content needs to be parsed which also will be covered briefly.
          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{w3c_dom,garsiel2011browsers,w3c_css21,w3c_html}}.
        \end{metatext}

        The \gls{DOM} defines a platform-neutral model for events and node trees, which is used for representing and interacting with \glspl{document}.
        The \gls{DOM} provides an interface for programs (\gls{JavaScript} in the \gls{browser}) to access and mutate the structure, style, and content of \glspl{document}.
        Elements of the \gls{document} are converted to \gls{DOM} nodes, and therefore the whole \gls{document} is represented as a tree structure of \gls{DOM} nodes which is referred to as the \gls{DOM} tree.

        \Glspl{layout engine} construct \gls{DOM} trees by parsing \gls{HTML} with any included \gls{CSS} and \gls{JavaScript}.
        Parsing of \gls{HTML} is not an easy task, partly because it is expected (although not required) of layout engines to be forgiving of errors, such as handling malformed \gls{HTML}.
        As \gls{CSS} and JavasScript are stricter, their grammar can be expressed in a formal syntax and can therefore be parsed with a context free grammar parser.
        Another big quirk to parsing \gls{HTML} is that it is reentrant that means that the source may change during parsing, see listing~\ref{code:reentrant-html}.
        Script \glspl{element} are to be executed synchronously when encountered by the parser.
        If such script mutates the \gls{DOM}, then the parser will need to evaluate the changes made by the script and update the \gls{DOM} tree.
        External scripts need to be fetched in order to be executed, which halts the parsing unless the script \gls{element} states otherwise.
        It should be noted that although \gls{DOM} nodes do include a \code{style} property, the \gls{CSS} cascade does not affect the nodes in the \gls{DOM} tree, and the style properties do not represent the final style of the \gls{element}.
        Instead, for scripts to obtain the final computed style for an \gls{element} special functions needs to be called (e.g. \code{getComputedStyle} in \gls{JavaScript}\footnote{See \url{http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/\#dom-window-getcomputedstyleelt-pseudoelt} for details about the function.}).
        Since externally linked \gls{CSS} \glspl{document} do not directly affect the \gls{DOM} tree they could conceptually be fetched and parsed after the parsing of the \gls{HTML}.
        However, scripts can request the computed style of \gls{DOM} nodes and therefore either the parsing of \gls{HTML} needs to be halted in order to fetch and parse \gls{CSS} when needed, or the scripts accessing style properties of \gls{DOM} nodes need to be halted.
        A common optimization is to use a speculative parser that continues to parse the \gls{HTML} when the main parser has halted (for executing scripts usually).
        The speculative parser does not change the \gls{DOM} tree, instead it searches for external resources that can be fetched in parallel while waiting for the main parser to continue.

      \subsection{Render trees}\label{sec:render-tree}
        \begin{metatext}
          When the \gls{DOM} tree has been constructed and all external \gls{CSS} has been fetched and parsed, it is time for the \gls{layout engine} to create the \gls{render tree}.
          Here an explanation of the creation process and the structure of \glspl{render tree} will be given.
          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{garsiel2011browsers,w3c_css21}}.
        \end{metatext}

        A \gls{render tree} is a visual representation of the \gls{document}.
        In contrast to the \gls{DOM} tree, the \gls{render tree} only contains \glspl{element} that affect the rendered result in any way.
        The nodes of the \gls{render tree} are called \emph{renderers} (also known as \emph{frames} or \emph{render objects}), as the nodes are responsible for their own and all subnodes layout and rendering.
        In order to know how to render themselves, the final style of each renderer needs to be computed which is done by the \gls{layout engine} while constructing the tree.
        Each renderer represents a rectangle (with a size and position) with a given style.
        There are different types of renderers, which affect how the renderer rectangle is computed.
        The type can be directly affected by the \code{display} style property.

        Typically nodes of the \gls{DOM} tree have a 1:1 relation to nodes of the \gls{render tree}, but the relation can also be smaller or larger.
        Since the \gls{render tree} only contains nodes that affect the rendered result, nodes that do not affect the layout flow of the \gls{document} and that aren't visible will not be present in the \gls{render tree}.
        For instance, a \gls{DOM} node with the \code{display} property set to \code{none} will have the relation 1:0 (it will not be present in the \gls{render tree} because it is not visible and will not affect the layout flow).
        It should be noted that nodes with the \code{visibility} style property set to \code{hidden} will be present in the \gls{render tree}, although they are not visible, since they still affect the layout flow.

        Even though all style properties have been resolved for each node in the \gls{render tree} (through \gls{CSS} cascading), the renderers still do not know about the size and position of their rectangles.
        This is because some properties depend on the flow of the \gls{document}, which cannot be resolved by style cascading and this need to be computed through a layout.
        The layout process will resolve the final position and size of all renderers.

      \subsection{Style computation}\label{sec:style-computation}
        \begin{metatext}
          Both the \gls{render tree} and scripts need to be able to get the final style of \glspl{element}.
          % In order to know the final style of an \gls{element}, the style for each \gls{element} must be resolved.
          Here a brief explanation of selector matching, style cascading, inheritance and rule set weighting will be given.
          \gls{CSS} property definitions will also be described.
          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{garsiel2011browsers,w3c_css21,w3c_css_style_attr}}.
        \end{metatext}

        To trace how the style of an \gls{element} is computed can be a complex task, since there are many parameters to \gls{element} style computations.
        First, styles for an \gls{element} can be defined in several places:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item In the default styles of the \gls{browser}.
          \item In the user defined \gls{browser} style.
          \item In external \gls{CSS} \glspl{document}.
          \item In internal \gls{CSS} \code{style} tags in the \gls{document} head.
          \item In inline \gls{CSS} in the \code{style} \gls{element} attribute.
          \item In scripts modifying the \gls{element} style through the \gls{DOM} tree.
          \item In special attributes of the \gls{element} such as \code{bgcolor} (deprecated, but possible).
        \end{enumerate}
        This can be grouped into author, user and \gls{browser} styles.
        \todo{Clarify this.}
        The four first items have in common that they are \emph{cascading} their style rules through \emph{selector matching}, and may define rule sets.
        Selector matching conceptually finds all \glspl{element} in the \gls{DOM} tree that matches a \gls{CSS} selector, to apply style declarations of the rule set.
        The rule sets are weighted so that if a property is assigned values by multiple rule sets the one with highest weight will be applied.
        The weighting process starts with the origin of the style:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item In case of normal rule declarations, the style weighting relation is: $browser < user < author$.
          \item Important rule declarations have the following relation: $author < user$.
        \end{itemize}
        The weighting process continues by calculating the \gls{specificity} of all rule set selectors, the higher the \gls{specificity} the higher the rule set will be weighted.
        This will make rule sets with more specific selectors override rule sets with more general selectors.
        Finally, if two rule declarations have the same weight, origin and \gls{specificity} the rule set specified last will win.
        Inline \gls{CSS} does not cascade since all rules given are automatically matched with the \gls{element} of the style attribute.
        However, inline \gls{CSS} is considered with highest possible \gls{specificity} when performing the style cascade.
        It is important to note that the styling methods number five and six are conceptually the same, since they both alter the style property of the \gls{DOM} representation of the \gls{element}.
        The last styling method, using special style attributes, is deprecated and all styles applied this way are weighted as low as possible.

        If the cascade results in no value for an \gls{element} style property, then the property can \emph{inherit} a value or have an initial value defined by the \gls{CSS} \emph{property definition}.
        Property definitions describe how the style properties should behave; see table~\ref{table:css_property_definition} for the format of property definitions.
        For instance, the \code{width} property definition states that legal values are absolute lengths, percentages or \code{auto} (which will let the \gls{browser} decide).
        The percentages are relative to the containing block.
        The initial value is \code{auto}, the properties applies to all non-replaced inline \glspl{element}, table rows and row groups.
        The value may not be inherited, and the media group is \code{visual}.
        The computed value is either the absolute length, calculated percentage of the containing block or what the \gls{browser} decides (in case of \code{auto}).
        If a property may inherit values, it will inherit the value of the first ancestor that has a value that is not \code{inherited}.

        \begin{table}[ht]\center
          \tiny
          \begin{tabular}[t]{ r | l }
            \textbf{Value} & Defines the legal values and the syntax. \\
            \textbf{Initial} & The initial value that the property will have. \\
            \textbf{Applies to} & The \glspl{element} that the property applies to. \\
            \textbf{Inherited} & Determines if the value should be inherited or not. \\
            \textbf{Percentages} & Defines if percentages are applicable, and how they should be interpreted. \\
            \textbf{Media} & Defines which media group the property applies to. \\
            \textbf{Computed value} & Describes how the value should be computed. \\
          \end{tabular}

          \label{table:css_property_definition}
        \end{table}

        This process will resolve most style properties, but as stated in section~\ref{sec:render-tree} some properties require a layout in order to be resolved.

      \subsection{The layout process}\label{sec:layout-process}
        \begin{metatext}
          When the \gls{render tree} has been constructed, and the style properties have been resolved for all nodes, it is time to perform the actual layout.
          The layout process will decide the final computed style of all \glspl{element}, and needs to be done before rendering.
          This section will describe the layout process, discuss some performance aspects and show examples when layout happens.
          \todo{Maybe remove the examples bit.}
          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{garsiel2011browsers}}.
        \end{metatext}

        \gls{HTML} is flow based, which means that a \gls{document} layout (also known as a \emph{reflow}) can generally be performed top to bottom and left to right in one pass.
        This is possible because the geometry of \glspl{element} typically do not depend on the siblings or children\todo{Seems weird to say that flow is not dependent on children, since the height is propagated upwards.}.
        Layout is performed recursively by starting at the root of the tree, let the renderer render itself and all of its children which will render themselves and their children and so on.
        When a layout is performed on the whole \gls{render tree} it is called a \emph{global layout}.
        To avoid global layouts when a renderer has been changed, a dirty bit system is usually implemented.
        The system marks which renderers in the tree that need a layout, which avoids layout of unaffected \glspl{element}.
        Layouts that only layout the dirty renderers are called \emph{incremental layouts}.
        A \gls{layout engine} that uses the dirty bit system usually keeps a queue of incremental layout commands.
        The scheduler system later triggers a \glslink{batch processing}{batch execution} of the incremental layout commands asynchronously.
        A global layout is triggered when the \gls{viewport} is resized or when styles that affect the whole \gls{document} is changed (such as \code{font-size}).
        Because the \gls{API} of \code{getComputedStyle} promises resolved values for all style properties, calling the function forces a full layout (flushing the incremental layout commands queue).
        When a renderer performs a layout the following usually happens:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The own width of the renderer is determined.
          \item The renderer positions all children and requests them to layout themselves (with given position and width).
          \item The heights, margins and paddings of the children are accumulated in order to decide the own height of the renderer.
        \end{enumerate}
        Of course, only the children that need a layout will be affected (dirty, or global layout) in step 2.
        So, the widths and positions are sent down in the tree and the heights are sent up in the tree in order to construct the final layout.

        The widths are calculated by the \code{width} style of the \glspl{element}, relative to the container \gls{element} width.
        Margins and paddings are also taken into account when calculating the widths.
        When the width of an \gls{element} is calculated, it needs to be controlled against the \code{min-width} and \code{max-width} style properties and make sure that the width is inside the given range.
        If the content of an \gls{element} does not fit with the calculated width (text usually needs to perform line break when the width is too small), the \gls{element} needs to break up the content into multiple renderers in order to expand the height.
        The renderer that has decided that it needs to break the content up into multiple renderers propagates to the parent renderer that it needs to perform the breaking.
        When the parent renderer has created the renderers needed to fit the content with the given height, layout is performed on the new renderers and then the final height can be calculated and propagated upwards.
      \subsection{Parallelization}\label{sec:parallel}
        \begin{metatext}
          No longer can performance of an application increase over time without any code changes (as opposed to the times when the \gls{CPU} clock speeds increased rapidly).
          Now, applications need to utilize the multiple cores of the \gls{CPU} instead of relying on high clock speed.
          Parallelization is something \gls{layout engine} vendors are interested in, and research is being done about utilizing multiple cores to increase the performance of the engines.
          In this section a small summary will be given about the current research front, and how the parallelization can be approached.
          This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{zoomm,parallelizing_the_web_browser,meyerovich2010fast,servo_parallel,servo_blog}}.
          \todo{Check so that the section actually does what the meta says}
        \end{metatext}

        As \gls{web} applications grow bigger and more demanding, \glspl{browser} continuously need to improve the performance on all levels.
        Fetching resources over the network is the only thing that is done in parallel today.
        The rest of the \gls{browser} system is designed and optimized to run sequentially.
        On computers, \glspl{browser} usually achieve parallelism by running each page context in parallel (each tab and window of the \gls{browser} runs in a separate process).
        This approach is appealing because it utilizes the cores of the machine by still having all subsystems run sequentially for each page, while improving the overall performance of the \gls{browser}.
        However, this approach is not enough.
        The page performance is not improved if only one page is present.
        For the \gls{web} to be a true competitor to heavy native applications\todo{Reformulate to not use the word native.}, the page performance needs to be increased (not only the overall \gls{browser} performance).
        It is then important to be able to dedicate multiple cores to one page instead of having all the pages present using their own core (perhaps all non-visible pages can share one core while the main visible page can have access to multiple cores if needed).
        Also, with the number of mobile devices browsing the \gls{web} increasing rapidly it is important to be able to achieve good parallelism.
        Light devices such as small laptops, mobile phones and tablets share a common goal --- they want to reduce power consumption while increasing the performance.
        This can be achieved with multicore processors that run at lower clock speeds.
        \todo{Write that many cores is preferred over high clock speed? Why?}
        It has been shown that the performance of mobile \glspl{browser} is \gls{CPU} bound contrary to the common belief that they are network bandwidth bound \cite{parallelizing_the_web_browser}.
        This is why many researchers target light devices when trying to parallelize \gls{web} \glspl{browser}.
        Of course, once the methods have matured and been implemented, desktop layout engines will benefit from parallelization as well.

        \gls{CSS} selector matching is a good candidate for parallelization, due to matching nodes to selectors being independent from other selector matches.
        A successful parallelization of selector matching has been achieved with locality-aware task parallelism \cite{parallelizing_the_web_browser}.
        It has also been shown that selector matching and style resolving (through cascading) can be parallelized \cite{zoomm}.
        It is possible to resolve \gls{element} styles in parallel as long as two requirements are fulfilled: the matching task must have finished for the \gls{element} to resolve styles for, and the parent \gls{element} must have resolved all styles (since the \gls{element} might inherit some styles from the parent).
        As long as these requirements are fulfilled, selector matching and style resolving can run in parallel for different \glspl{element}.
        The layout process can also be parallelized, since the layout process has been shown to be subtree independent for non-float \glspl{element} \cite{servo_parallel,servo_blog}.
        Siblings of the layout tree can be processed independently of each other (in the general case), and is suitable to parallelize with a work-stealing algorithm\footnote{See \url{http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/steal.pdf} for more information about work-stealing algorithms.} \cite{meyerovich2010fast}.
        \todo[inline]{Philipp: It would be very interesting to just shortly summarize typical performance gains due to parallelization.}

      \subsection{Layout thrashing and how to avoid it}\label{sec:layout-thrashing}
        \begin{metatext}
          This section will present what \gls{layout thrashing} is and how it can be prevented.
          Avoiding \gls{layout thrashing} is important when optimizing \gls{DOM} manipulations, and will be a key element to constructing a performant third-party library.
        \end{metatext}

        Recall from section \ref{sec:layout-process} that \glspl{layout engine} store incremental layout commands in a queue in order to \glslink{batch processing}{batch process} layouts.
        The term \gls{layout thrashing} refers to when the layout queue repeatedly is being flushed by scripts; forcing the \gls{layout engine} to perform multiple independent layouts that could have in theory been \glslink{batch processing}{batch processed}.
        Layouts are \emph{thrashed} since the layout engine usually needs to perform layout on the whole subtree of the affected element for each incremental layout command, hence thrashing most of the work it did the previous layout command.
        See listing~\ref{code:thrashing-example} for an example of \gls{JavaScript} code that results in layout thrashing.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example of layout thrashing. The code reads and double the widths of 1000 \glspl{element} in \textasciitilde700 ms. The \code{parseSize} function is not important to understand the example.}, captionpos=b, label={code:thrashing-example}]
          /* Doubles the width of each element in the elements collection parameter. */
          function doubleWidths(elements) {
            elements.forEach(function readWriteWidth(element) {
              var width = parseSize(getComputedStyle(element).width);
              element.style.width = width * 2 + "px";
            });
          }

          // 1000 div elements as only children of a div container.
          var elements = [...];
          doubleWidths(elements); // ~700 ms
        \end{lstlisting}
        For each element given as parameter to the \code{doubleWidths} function, the \code{readWriteWidth} function is called with an element as argument.
        In that function, the computed style of the element is requested, which will force a style computation for that element.
        If any \gls{DOM} node affecting the element is marked as dirty, a layout will also need to be performed before returning the computed style of the element.
        When the computed style has been acquired, the width of the element is set to a new value, which is a \gls{DOM} mutation that will need to be synchronized with the render tree.
        Therefore, the element and its ancestors will be marked as dirty.
        The next time \code{getComputedStyle} is called, which happens when processing the next element in the collection, a layout will be forced since \gls{DOM} nodes that affects the elements has been marked as dirty.
        See figure~\ref{fig:layout-thrashing-example-1} for a visualization of the execution of the \code{doubleWidths} function.
        It is shown in the figure that style computations and layout is performed in each iteration.
        The total time spent on style computations is \textasciitilde40 ms and layout is \textasciitilde600 ms, which leaves \textasciitilde60 ms for the actual script execution.

        \begin{figure}[h]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/layout-thrashing-example-1-big}
          \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/layout-thrashing-example-1}
          \caption{Two timeline figures of executing the example code given in listing~\ref{code:thrashing-example}. Both figures show the same timeline, where the top figure shows the whole execution and the bottom only shows a small section of the execution. Notice that they do not share the same time axis. Here it is clear that layout thrashing occurs, since layout is being done repeatedly throughout the whole execution (each iteration in the loop).}
          \label{fig:layout-thrashing-example-1}
        \end{figure}
        
        To avoid layout thrashing, the computed style requests and \gls{DOM} mutations need to be performed in batches, as presented in listing~\ref{code:thrashing-example-fixed}.
        While it is algorithmically inefficient to iterate over the same collection twice --- the batched approach executes \textasciitilde100 times faster than the original version.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example of avoiding layout thrashing by batch processing reads and writes to the \gls{DOM}. The code reads and double the widths of 1000 \glspl{element} in \textasciitilde7 ms.}, captionpos=b, label={code:thrashing-example-fixed}]
          /* Doubles the width of each element in the elements collection parameter. */
          function doubleWidths(elements) {
            var widths = [];

            // First retrieve all element widths.
            elements.forEach(function getWidths(element) {
              var width = parseSize(getComputedStyle(element).width);
              widths.push(width);
            });

            // Then mutate the DOM with the new widths.
            elements.forEach(function writeWidths(element, index) {
              element.style.width = widths[index] * 2 + "px";
            });
          }

          // 1000 div elements as only children of a div container.
          var elements = [...];
          doubleWidths(elements); // ~7 ms
        \end{lstlisting}
        Now, the \code{doubleWidths} function performs two batches that both iterates over the elements collection.
        In the first batch, all widths of all elements are acquired and stored in a collection.
        Since no \gls{DOM} mutation occurs in the first batch, the layout engine does not need to perform any layout while retrieving the styles.
        In the second batch, all elements are assigned the new widths based on the widths retrieved in the first batch.
        Since the script does not read the \gls{DOM} in any way during in the second batch, all \gls{DOM} mutations can be queued by the layout engine to be batch processed.
        See figure~\ref{fig:layout-thrashing-example-1-fixed} for a visualization of the execution of the batched example version.
        In the figure, it is clear that the layout engine is able to first execute the JavaScript, and later perform all style and layout computations in a batch.
        \begin{figure}[h]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/layout-thrashing-example-1-fixed}
          \caption{A timeline of executing the example code given in listing~\ref{code:thrashing-example-fixed}. It is clear in the figure that layout thrashing does not occur, since all style computations and layout is performed in a batch after that the example code has finished executing.}
          \label{fig:layout-thrashing-example-1-fixed}
        \end{figure}

        The total time spent on style computations has been reduced to \textasciitilde2 ms, layout to \textasciitilde1.5 ms, and the actual script execution to \textasciitilde3.5 ms.
        It should be noted that both versions recalculate styles for the same number of elements, from now on denoted by $n$.
        Pausing the JavaScript context and switching the layout engine to style computation mode causes an overhead cost, from now on denoted by the constant $O_{s}$.
        Let $C_{s}$ denote the time it takes for the layout engine to calculate the style of one element, then the total time needed for style computations in the first version is given by $T(n) = n(O_s + C_s)$.
        Since the second version enabled the layout engine to calculate the style of all elements in a batch, the total time needed was reduced to $T(n) = nC_s + O_s$.
        The style computation was reduced from \textasciitilde40 ms to \textasciitilde2 ms because the second version avoids $n - 1$ overhead costs.
        However, it should be noted that both versions have time complexity $O(n)$.
        
        The major part of the time reduction is due to the layout time being significantly reduced.
        The reason why the layout time was significantly reduced is because the two versions do not perform layout on the same amount of elements.
        When an element and its ancestors has been marked as dirty, a layout will need to be performed on the subtree which contains at least all $n$ elements and possibly some ancestor elements.
        So the minimum number of nodes that need to be laid out is given by $n + n_{a}$, where $n_a$ is the number of ancestor elements.
        Since the first version forces the layout engine to perform a layout in each iteration, the minimum number of elements laid out is given by $n(n + n_a)$.
        Similar to style computation, performing a layout also has an overhead cost $O_{l}$.
        Let $C_{l}$ denote the time it takes for the layout engine to layout one element, then the total time needed for layout in the first version is given by $T(n) = n(O_{l} + C_{l}(n + n_a))$.
        The second version enables the layout engine to batch process the \gls{DOM} manipulations, and therefore only one layout of the subtree will need to be performed, which results in the minimum number of elements laid out being $n + n_a$.
        The total time needed for layout in the second version is then given by $T(n) = O_{l} + C_{l}(n + n_a)$.
        The first version has time complexity $O(n^2)$ while the second version has time complexity $O(n)$, which is a significant optimization.

  \chapter{Element queries}\label{chp:eq}
    \begin{metatext}
      Now that a good understanding of \glspl{browser} (especially the \gls{layout engine}), \gls{responsive} design, and modular development has been acquired it is time to address element queries --- a solution to the modular \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design problem.
      This chapter will define element queries, present why they are needed.
      It will also address some of the issues of implementing element queries being \glslink{native}{natively} in section~\ref{sec:eq-problems}.
      Further, some possible approaches to overcome the problems will be presented in section~\ref{sec:solutions}.
      \todo{Instead write that some solutions will be presented?}
    \end{metatext}

    \todo[inline]{Describe a common use case? The thesis talks about "the common/general use case" a lot, but never really defines what that is.}

    \todo[inline]{Make additional sections: "common/general use cases" and "definition" to include the text below?}

    Recall from section~\ref{sec:rwd} that \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design is the concept of having \glspl{element} respond to size changes.
    \todo[color=red]{Tomas: Or that modules can programatically work in many different sizes}
    \todo[color=green]{Marcos: Maybe embellish that bit... "...respond to size change, so that a document may be usable on many screen sizes, resolutions, pixel-densities, and media." or something like that.}
    \Gls{responsive} \gls{web} design implements this by using \gls{media queries}, applying conditional rules with relation to the \gls{viewport} size.
    In section~\ref{sec:modularity} the desire for building modular \gls{web} components was presented.
    One positive outcome of building applications in a modular way is that general components become reusable.
    Since the only way of applying conditional rules to \glspl{element} today is by using \gls{media queries}, all \gls{responsive} styles must be defined by the application and not by the modules (because only the application knows how much space each module will be given in the application layout).
    The implication of this is that the \gls{HTML} and \gls{JavaScript} can be written in a modular way, but the \gls{CSS} is left for the user of the module (application) to write which somewhat defeats the purpose of writing modules.
    So developers today have two choices: writing modules that are not \gls{responsive} but \gls{encapsulated}, or writing modules that are \gls{responsive} but not \gls{encapsulated} (leaving the styling to the user).

    An identified solution to this is element queries, which allows conditional rules to be applied based on any criteria for any \gls{element}.
    Figure~\ref{fig:mq-vs-eq} shows the problem with \gls{media queries} and the element query solution.
    The typical use case is to write conditional styles to be applied based on the container \gls{element} size.
    Although the size of the container \gls{element} is typically the most interesting element query with \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design, element queries as a concept does not need to be limited to that.
    It is also possible to apply conditional rules by any \gls{element} display property, color, text alignment, and so on.
    Theoretically it should be possible to query any style property of an \gls{element}, but the focus will be the \code{width} and \code{height} properties since they are the most interesting in \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design.

        The module is \gls{responsive}, so when it is small it should change color to red and change the inner text a bit.
        The left version is built with \gls{media queries}; hence all module instances stay blue even though some are small (only a smaller \gls{viewport} will trigger the modules to change style).
        The right version is built with element queries, hence the modules display differently depending on the given size that each module has, which is the desired behavior.}

    \section{Problems}\label{sec:eq-problems}
      \begin{metatext}
        One reason that hinders element queries from being implemented natively in browsers is that they bring problems and limitations to layout engines.
        It is stated on the W3C's www-style mailing list \cite{w3c_eq_mail} by Zbarsky of Mozilla, Atkins of Google and Sprehn of Google that unrestricted element queries is infeasible to implement.
        It is important to understand the problems in order to speculate about a potential \gls{native} \gls{API} design.
        \todo{Rewrite a bit if native API is dropped.}
        In this section the two major problems will be presented: performance and circularity.
      \end{metatext}

      \subsection{Performance}
        \begin{metatext}
          This section will present the performance impacts that element queries have on \glspl{layout engine}.
          As shown in section~\ref{sec:parallel} \gls{layout engine} vendors are interested in parallelizing their engines to increase the page performance.
          Element queries limits the parallelization, which will be the focus of this section.
          This section is partly based on \normalfont{\cite{w3c_eq_mail}}.
        \end{metatext}

        Recall from section~\ref{sec:layout-process} that the rectangle size and position for each \gls{element} is calculated in the layout process, and cannot be determined before an actual layout has happened.
        This imposes that a layout pass needs to be performed before knowing the \gls{element}'s sizes.
        If element queries are present that rely on the size of \glspl{element}, which is the identified common use case, the following process needs to happen:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item A layout pass needs to be performed in order to calculate the size of the \glspl{element} targeted by element queries.
          \item The element query conditional rules need to be evaluated against the \glspl{element} to know which rules should be applied (element query selector matching).
          \item If the element query selector matching has resulted in a different matching set than in step 1, the process is repeated (with the new rules applied).
        \end{enumerate}
        So, element query selector matching changes result in performing another layout, which discards at least a subtree of the previous layout.
        As already stated, this only occurs when the layout has changed in a way that changes the element query selectors.
        Unfortunately, this means that if there is any matching element query selector at page load, two layout passes will always be performed.

        Further, it is common for internal \glspl{API} in \glspl{layout engine} to request updated \gls{element} styles that do not require layout to resolve (non-layout properties such as \code{color} and \code{font-family}).
        Since a layout of the element query selector target is required in order to resolve the correct \gls{element} style, such internal \glspl{API} requires a layout in order to obtain the correct \gls{element} style (even for non-layout related properties).
        Also, \glspl{layout engine} would not be able to layout subtrees in parallel since an \gls{element} in one subtree might affect an \gls{element} in another subtree.

        \todo{Totally forgot to write about parallel problems}

      \subsection{Circularity}\label{sec:cyclic-rules}
        \begin{metatext}
          This section will show how cyclic rules may occur and why it is a problem.
          It will also be presented why cyclic rules must be detected at runtime.
          Some examples will be given to better understand the complexity of the problem.
        \end{metatext}

        The most obvious occurrences of cyclic rules are when there are specified conflicting width element queries and width updates for an \gls{element}.
        See listing~\ref{code:cyclic-simple} for the perhaps simplest example of cyclic rules.
        The syntax of element queries will be presented in section~\ref{sec:native-eq}\todo{Have the explanation before this section? On the other hand this section is needed for the motivation of the syntax of the native API}, and is not important to understand the problem.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Simple example of cyclic rules with directly conflicting width element queries and updates.}, captionpos=b, label={code:cyclic-simple}]
          #foo {
            width: 250px;
          }

          #foo:eq(width < 300px) {
            /* This rule will be applied only when the width of #foo is < 300px. */
            width: 550px;
          }

          #foo:eq(width > 500px) {
            /* This rule will be applied only when the width of #foo is > 500px. */
            width: 250px;
          }
        \end{lstlisting}

        The following happens to the \gls{element}:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The initial width of the \code{\#foo} \gls{element} is set to 250 pixels.
        After a layout, the \code{\#foo:eq(width < 300px)} matches and therefore next step will be 2.
        \item The width of the \gls{element} is under 300 pixels, so the selector \code{\#foo:eq(width < 300px)} matches.
        Note that the \code{\#foo:eq(width > 500px)} does not match, since the width is under 500 pixels.
        Since the matched selector is more specific than the \code{\#foo} selector, the new width of the \gls{element} is 550 pixels.
        Next step will be 3.
        \item The width of the \gls{element} is above 500 pixels, so the selector \code{\#foo:eq(width > 500px)} matches.
        Note that the \code{\#foo:eq(width < 300px)} does not match, since the width is above 300 pixels.
        Since the matched selector is more specific than the \code{\#foo} selector, the new width of the \gls{element} is 250 pixels.
        Next step will be 2.
        \end{enumerate}
        Clearly, the \gls{browser} will be stuck in an infinite layout cycle pending back and forth between step 2 and 3 (250 pixels and 550 pixels).
        The result of this is of course implementation dependent.
        One reasonable outcome of such infinite layout loop is that the \gls{layout engine} executes one layout pass and then evaluate the next set of matched selectors and so on, which leads to a functioning page but since a relayout is enforced every update, the performance impact is significant.
        This example is somewhat similar to writing \code{while(true);} outside the scope of a generator function in JavaScript (i.e., it just locks up the main thread), which obviously is a bad idea.
        However, cyclic rules can also occur in less obvious ways. 

        Indirect cyclic rules are somewhat more complex to reason about, than the example given above (which is an example of direct cyclic rules).
        For instance, if the \code{\#foo} \gls{element} matches the width of a child \gls{element}, and the child changes width depending on the parent width, a cycle might occur.
        Consider the code in listing~\ref{code:cyclic-2}.
        
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example of indirect cyclic rules. Here the user (\code{\#foo}) of the module (\code{\#module}) creates cyclic rules indirectly by specifying that it should match the width of the module.}, captionpos=b, label={code:cyclic-2}]
          /* HTML */
          <div id="foo">
            <div id="module">
              <div id="child"></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          /* CSS */
          #foo {
            /* Will match the width of the child element #module. */
            display: inline-block;
          }

          #module {
            /* Matches the width of the parent element #foo. */
            width: 100%;
          }

          #child {
            width: 250px;
          }

          #module:eq(max-width: 300px) #child {
            /* This rule applies only when the width of #module is <= 300px. */
            width: 550px;
          }

          #module:eq(min-width: 500px) #child {
            /* This rule applies only when the width of #module is >= 500px. */
            width: 250px;
          }
        \end{lstlisting}
        What makes this situation more complex than the previous example is that it is less obvious for the developer to identify that there are cyclic rules.
        First, the problem cannot be found without considering the rule sets of both the module and the \code{\#foo} element.
        Second, the rules of the module elements and the rules of the \code{\#foo} \gls{element} might be separated into different parts of the stylesheet or different stylesheets.
        Third, the user of the module must be aware of how it styles itself in order to understand the limitations it imposes.
        By adding one line to the containg element \code{\#foo} a cycle appears in another part of the program (in the module).
        A \gls{JavaScript} equivalent of this example would perhaps be \code{var bar = true; while(bar);} with the motivation that it is still obvious that it results in an infinite loop but both the loop and the variable needs to be considered.
        Also, the variable assignment could happen in another part of the program.

        The examples given so far have been simple, and can easily be identified as cyclic by reviewing the \gls{CSS} code.
        It would also be possible for the browser (or any other program) to detect the cycles at parsetime.
        However, cycles can occur in a complexer way that cannot be detected at parsetime.
        Consider the code in listing~\ref{code:cyclic-3}.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example of cyclic rules that cannot be detected at parsetime.}, captionpos=b, label={code:cyclic-3}]
          /* HTML */
          <span id="foo">
            When in doubt, mumble.
          </span>

          #foo:eq(width < 300px) {
            /* This rule applies only when the width of #foo is < 300px. */
            font-size: 2em;
          }
        \end{lstlisting}
        In this example, it is impossible to deduce if the rules are cyclic at parsetime.
        It could perhaps guess that it could result in a cycle in some cases but that is also the point of the example --- it is only cyclic in some scenarios.
        The size of the \code{\#foo} element will depend on the content of it (i.e, the text).
        The width of the text depends on the font size, which is inherited.
        So the width of the \code{\#foo} \gls{element} is dependent on the inherited font size.
        When the \code{\#foo} \gls{element} is below 300 pixels wide, the font size of the element is increased to \code{2em} (which is a unit that is relative to the inherited value).
        If a \code{2em} font size results in a computed font size big enough to make the \gls{element} wider than 300 pixels, the \code{\#foo:eq(width < 300px)} selector will not match and therefore the element will no longer have font size \code{2em}.
        Since the element width is decreased below 300 pixels when the font size of \code{2em} no longer is applied, the selector will match again --- the rules are cyclic.
        However, in another scenario the inherited font size might not be big enough to make the \code{\#foo} element wider than 300 pixels which would not result in a cycle.
        The factors that creates the cycle are the following:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The display type of the \gls{element}
          \item The \gls{element} queries of the \gls{element}
          \item The font size value of the \gls{element}
          \item \textbf{The inherited font size of the \gls{element}}
          \item \textbf{The content of the \gls{element}}
        \end{itemize}
        The factors in bold are worst than the other ones presented, since they may depend on runtime actions and values.
        In this example the text is static but it could have been added dynamically.
        Also, the inherited font size value depends on the closest ancestor with a font size property defined.
        Since ancestors can have their font sizes defined in relative units, the dependency tree can go up to the root of the \gls{document}.
        Further, if no ancestor defines an absolute value for the font size it is up to the \gls{browser} to default to a size, which is impossible to reason about at parsetime.
        This implies that there is no way of telling if the cycle appears or not without actually running the code.
        Also, the cycle may appear in different \glspl{browser} and settings, which makes the cycle even harder to detect.
        
        \todo[inline]{Try to descibe a scenario where a cycle appears, that is actually a valid use case?}
        % Far worse is that the previous examples have been of the \code{while(true);} character, which gives the false hope that even though it is possible to create cycles developers would never encounter it since ``real'' code would not be close to the examples given here.
        % With the third example, this is no longer true.
        % Increasing the font size when the layout area is smaller and decreasing the font size when the layout area is bigger is something that is frequently done in \gls{responsive} \gls{web} design.
        % Typically \gls{web} site authors want the font size to increase on handheld devices, to increase the readability.
        % Of course, the numbers given in the example might not be reasonable, but in concept it is valid use case that may result in cyclic rules.

    \section{Possible solutions}\label{sec:solutions}
      \begin{metatext}
        Now that the problems of element queries have been presented, it is time to show two approaches to solve the problems.
        The first approach limits element queries a lot, but avoids many of the problems this way while still enabling element queries for the common use case.
        This approach has been discussed at the \gls{W3C} and the initial draft of the \gls{RICG} assumes that this is a prerequisite to a \gls{native} implementation.
        The second approach is to provide element queries as a third-party library which operates element queries on top of the layout engine (in JavaScript).
        Although not a solution to the native problems, it still provides functioning unrestricted element queries while not hindering parallelization of layout engines.
        However, this approach does not solve the problem of cyclic rules.
        The different solution approaches either limits element queries in some way or solves only a subproblem, so no perfect solution that hinders element queries unlimited with decent performance and low complexity has been found.
        The section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{w3c_eq_mail,ricg_irc_log,ricg_issue_viewport,w3c_css21}}.
      \end{metatext}

      \todo[inline,color=green]{Marcos: Should rewrite this to not be exclusive to a viewport element. Could also be an attribute.}

      By limiting element queries to special \gls{viewport} container \glspl{element} that can only be queried by child \glspl{element}, many of the problems are resolved.
      This means that a new \gls{HTML} tag would be crafted (perhaps named \code{viewport}) that defines separated \glspl{viewport} in the \gls{document}.
      In order to avoid cyclic rules, the following limitations to the \code{viewport} would be defined:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item\label{viewport-rule-1} The size of the \gls{element} may not be dependent on its children. This implies that all \gls{CSS} that causes the \gls{element} to be shrunken to fit the content are invalid.
        \item\label{viewport-rule-2} The selector may only include the \code{viewport} \gls{element} targeted by element queries as a part of the expression of a selector (not the right-most simple selector).
        \item\label{viewport-rule-3} Only the nearest \code{viewport} ancestor of the right-most simple selector may be targeted for element queries in selectors.
      \end{enumerate}
      See listing~\ref{code:viewport-selectors} for examples of valid and invalid CSS selectors according to the rules defined above.
      \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=8,caption={Examples of valid and invalid selectors with the imaginary \code{viewport} element.}, captionpos=b, label={code:viewport-selectors}]
        /* HTML */
        <viewport id="outer">
          <viewport id="inner">
            <p id="foo">Imaginary viewport elements</p>
          </viewport>
        </viewport>

        /* CSS */

        /* valid */
        viewport:eq(width > 500px) p { ... }

        /* valid */
        viewport viewport:eq(width > 500px) p { ... }

        /* invalid, violates rule (*@\ref{viewport-rule-1}@*) */
        viewport { display: inline; }

        /* invalid, violates rule (*@\ref{viewport-rule-2}@*) */
        p viewport:eq(width > 500px) { ... }

        /* invalid, violates rule (*@\ref{viewport-rule-3}@*) */
        viewport:eq(width > 1000) viewport:eq(width > 500px) p { ... }

        /* invalid, violates rule (*@\ref{viewport-rule-3}@*) */
        #outer:eq(width > 500px) #foo { ... }
      \end{lstlisting}        
      This approach also solves many of the performance problems, but not all.
      The reason that a new \gls{HTML} tag is proposed instead of a new \gls{CSS} property that defines the behavior is because the \gls{layout engine} in the latter case needs to resolve the styles for all \glspl{element} in order to know which are \gls{viewport} \glspl{element}.
      With a new \gls{HTML} tag, the \gls{layout engine} can know after it has parsed the \gls{HTML} which \glspl{element} are supposed to be treated at separate viewports.
      This way, parallelizing the selector matching and style computation is possible (as opposed to if the style for each element needs to be resolved in order to know the \code{viewport} \glspl{element}).
      Also, the internal \glspl{API} that request non-layout information for the \glspl{element} using element queries only need to make sure that the containing \gls{viewport} \gls{element} has been laid out before resolving the styles.
      The layout can be done in one pass as long as the \gls{viewport} \glspl{element} are laid out before their children.
      Since the queries may only be targeting the nearest \gls{viewport} \gls{element} ancestor, each \gls{viewport} subtree can be laid out in parallel.
      However, it is still inconvenient that the \gls{layout engine} would need to evaluate all element query selectors in the middle of a layout pass (after the that the \gls{viewport} \glspl{element} has been laid out) in order to resolve the styles for the \gls{viewport} children.

      Obviously, this limits element queries a lot.
      The fact that the size of the \gls{viewport} \gls{element} cannot depend on the children (like normal block \glspl{element} do), limits the usability.
      The \code{viewport} \gls{element} would behave much like the \code{iframe} \gls{element} layout-wise.
      It should be noted that \code{iframe} \glspl{element} are not suitable as an alternative to the proposed \code{viewport} \gls{element}, since \code{iframe} elements are much more limited by nature (creates a new \gls{document} and script context).
      The idea is that the \gls{viewport} cannot be queried for properties that the children may affect (such as the width and height style properties).
      In order to allow the children to query the properties, they cannot be affected by the children.
      In theory it should mean that if no child query for instance the height of the \gls{viewport}, then the \gls{viewport} may depend on the children for it's height.
      This is a powerful insight, since the general use case would be to write element queries against the width and have the \glspl{element} adapt their heights accordingly (including the \gls{viewport} \gls{element}).
      \todo[inline]{Maybe note seamless iframe in theory works in the same way. But would it be relevant?}

      Another approach to enable element queries for developers is to provide a \gls{third-party} \gls{JavaScript} library.
      Since a \gls{JavaScript} library does not depend on vendors of \glspl{layout engine} (other than features in the current language specifications) it can therefore be designed in any desired way.
      It would be more feasible to have unrestricted element queries in a \gls{JavaScript} library, than implementing it natively.
      Since the element queries feature would be operated by the library, \glspl{layout engine} can be parallelized unhindered and independently of how the library handles the queries.
      Similar, cycle detection and handling can be handled on top of the \gls{layout engine} by the library.
      Although an implementation in \gls{JavaScript} will be slower than a \gls{native} implementation, it can still be beneficial to have such feature implemented as a \gls{third-party} library to avoid complex and restricting code in \glspl{layout engine}.
      Also, without the \gls{layout engine} aware of the element queries it could be hard to avoid multiple relayouts.

  \chapter{Library design}
    \begin{metatext}
      Before starting the actual implementation, it is important to have an overall design to follow.
      In this chapter, the library design will be described and a motivation why the library should be plugin based will be given.
      The subsystems of the library and their interactions will also be presented.
    \end{metatext}

    \todo[inline]{Write somewhere that it might be an option to not have a resize detection system, but instead let the user manually check the elements when they may have changed.}

    First of all, a working name of the library needs to be established --- the library will from now on have the working name \abbr{elq}.
    This name serves as a prefix for many of the library \glspl{API}, and will be frequently used in the report from now on.
    The technical goals of \abbr{elq} will be stated in section~\ref{sec:techincal-goals}.
    In section~\ref{sec:arcithecture} the architecture will be described, and the subsystems of \abbr{elq} will be presented.
    Last, the \gls{API} will be defined in section~\ref{sec:elq-api}.

    \section{Technical goals}\label{sec:techincal-goals}
      \begin{metatext}
        Before presenting the overall design of the library, the technical goals will be stated.
        It will be shown that the goals and use cases can vary from case to case, which will be the main argument to why the library should be plugin based.
      \end{metatext}

      Expectations and requirements of element queries vary greatly by use cases.
      As usual in software development, tradeoffs need to be made.
      Some projects value simplicity and ease of use, while other projects demand advanced features and high performance.
      The requirements can be grouped into four categories; features, ease of use, performance and compatibility.
      Identified possible requirements of the library are the following:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Features}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item\label{itm:req_resize_detect} The library needs to augment \gls{native} element queries in the sense that styles are applied automatically on \gls{element} resizes.
            \item The features should be flexible and not limited to only the common use cases.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Ease of use}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item\label{itm:req_big_rewrite} Developers should not need to perform big rewrites of their modules or applications in order to use the library.
            \item\label{itm:natural} The \glspl{API} need to feel natural and should not seem alien to \gls{web} developers.
            \item The library should help identifying cyclic rules and prevent them from causing infinite layouts.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Performance}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item The library needs to have adequate performance to empower large applications running on light devices.
            \item The library load time needs to be kept low.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Compatibility}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Older \glspl{browser} must be supported.
            \item The library may not require invalid \gls{CSS}, \gls{HTML} or \gls{JavaScript}.
            \item\label{itm:assumption} Dependencies and assumptions about the host application (including the development environment) should be kept low.
            \item\label{itm:req_prolyfill} The library must act as a prolyfill\footnote{A polyfill is something that provides a functionality that is expected to be provided \glslink{native}{natively} by \glspl{browser}. Polyfills usually fixes some standard functionality for \glspl{browser} that do not yet support it. A prolyfill is a polyfill for something that will probably become a standard.} for \gls{native} element queries.
          \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
      It would be possible to create a library that conforms to all of the requirements but added features, automation and compatibility most probably would decrease the performance and load time.
      In the same way, too many advanced features may decrease the ease of use and simplicity of the \gls{API}.
      Some feature may also restrict the compatibility.
      Trying to conform to all of the requirements and trying to find a balance would result in a worse solution than a library tailored for specific requirements.
      By providing a good library foundation and plugins for different use cases it is up to developers to choose the right plugins for each project.
      This way, developers are composing their own custom tailored solution for their specific use cases.
      In addition, by letting the plugins satisfy the requirements it is easy to extend the library with new plugins when new requirements arise.
      For instance, the requirement~\ref{itm:req_prolyfill} is beneficial to satisfy with a plugin since the \gls{API} for \gls{native} element queries can only be guessed at this point of time, which will probably lead to frequent changes to the plugin.
      By separating it from the core library (and the other plugins), only developers that really desire the prolyfill behavior must handle the rapid \gls{API} changes.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Architecture
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \section{Architecture}\label{sec:arcithecture}
      \begin{metatext}
        As it has been shown that a plugin based library is suitable, it is time to present the overall architecture of the library.
        The roles of each subsystem of the core library will also be explained.
      \end{metatext}

      \todo[inline]{Here the style state of the element is talked about. Maybe this should have been mentioned before? Perhaps in the chapter text?}

      To decide if a subsystem of the solution should be in the library core or a plugin is a difficult task.
      A balance needs to be found between ease of use, performance and extendability.
      All subsystems of the core need to provide a fundamental functionality to the library and also need to be general enough to be used by plugins in different ways.
      If a plugin needs to write a custom version of a subsystem in the core in order to work, the subsystem should perhaps not be part of the core.
      Each subsystem added to the core will impact the performance negatively (by slower load time in the best case) for all users, so they must impose a real value to existing and future plugins.
      The subsystems of the core always have the risk of being redundant, unnecessary and in other ways unwanted for some use cases.
      Therefore it is important that it is possible for developers to either remove them or change them.
      This way the more advanced users can choose which subsystems to alter, keeping the library easy to use for the common use cases.

      \input{p3-elq-architecture}

      Figure~\ref{fig:elq_architecture} shows the overall architecture of the library.
      The core consists of fundamental and general subsystems that are utilized by plugins.
      Developers should never be programming against the core directly, and it can therefore only be accessed by plugins through the hidden plugin \gls{API}.
      The library provides a small public \gls{API} which is mainly used to invoke and handle plugins.
      The plugins form the bigger part of the public \gls{API} in the sense that they decide which features exist and how they work.
      It should be noted that plugins may provide \glspl{API} through the library by registering methods, or by specifying custom syntax (such as markup or \gls{CSS}) which is beyond the control of the core.
      Plugins may also have interplugin \glspl{API} and dependencies, which also is beyond the control of the core.
      The core is supposed to have a slow development phase, with few changes and good backwards compatability.
      Plugins may be developed in a high rate, with frequent changes to support new features.
      Subsystems that are part of the core are the following:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reporter:}
          Responsible for reporting information, warnings and errors to the developer.
          By having a centralized reporter, it is possible to decide at a global library level how much plugins are allowed to report.
          Other options such as throwing exception on errors or warnings could also be set at a global library level.
          Also, the library can make sure that all reports are standardized and can provide extra information such as the name and version of the plugin along with its report.
          To avoid code duplication, it also beneficial to have a centralized report system so plugins do not need to perform the same compatibility checks (such as checking if the \gls{browser} actually supports console reporting).
        \item \textbf{Element resize detector:}
          Provides an interface for observing \gls{element} resize events.
          This system is fundamental to plugins fulfilling requirements \ref{itm:req_resize_detect} and \ref{itm:req_big_rewrite} since it enables the library to be aware of when \glspl{element} change sizes, instead of the host application keeping track of when \glspl{element} have changed sizes.
          \todo[inline]{Maybe this shouldn't be a core subsystem? Since this system imposes the biggest performance impact. It might make more sense to have this as a plugin.}
        \item \textbf{Cycle detector:}
          As shown in section~\ref{sec:cyclic-rules} cyclic rules need to be detected at runtime.
          When a plugin wish to update the size state of an \gls{element} (which in turn applies the conditional styles) it can ask this system if the update seems to be part of a cycle.
          If the update seems to be part of a cycle, it is up to the plugin how that should be handled.
          \todo[inline]{Write that this system is more general, and could potentially be used for detecting other cyclic behaviors?}
        \item \textbf{Batch processor:}
          To avoid \gls{layout thrashing}, it is important to read and mutate the \gls{DOM} in separate \glslink{batch processing}{batches}.
          This subsystem provides an interface for plugins to store functions to later be executed in a \glslink{batch processing}{batch}.
          To avoid \gls{layout thrashing} by other scripts it can beneficial to asynchronously postpone the \glslink{batch processing}{batch} until the next layout cycle of the \gls{browser}, which is also handled by the subsystem.
        \item \textbf{Plugin handler:}
          Of course, having plugins requires a subsystem for handling them.
          This system provides the interface for developers to add plugins to the library.
          The system is also responsible for retrieving the plugins, and invoking them on different library events.
      \end{itemize}
      Some of the subsystems may be partially accessible through the public \gls{API} such as the plugin handler and the \gls{element} resize detector.
      It should be noted that the presented core subsystems are not the only things that the library consists of, but the presented systems are the major ones.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% API design

    \section{API design}\label{sec:elq-api}
      \begin{metatext}
        This section will describe the \gls{API} of the library.
        First, the public \gls{API} of the core will be presented, followed by the plugin \gls{API}.
        After that, all plugins will be described in depth addressing their features, dependencies and \glspl{API}.
      \end{metatext}

      Recall from section~\ref{sec:arcithecture} that the bigger part of the public \gls{API} is provided by plugins.
      The role of the library is to provide plugins with systems to be used for performing element query tasks, which is done through the plugin \gls{API}.
      Three plugins will be developed; \code{breakpoints}, \code{mirror} and \code{prolyfill}.
      The \code{breakpoints} plugin provides 

      \subsection{Public API}\label{sec:public-api}
        \todo[inline]{Write how to install it. AMD, script, commonjs, etc.}

        In section~\ref{sec:techincal-goals} it was determined that advanced users must be able to change the subsystems used in the core.
        Therefore no global library instance will be instantiated automatically on load.
        Instead, a function \code{Elq} that creates \abbr{elq} instances is provided in order to be able to inject dependencies.
        The function accepts an optional options object parameter, where it is possible to set options and subsystems to be used for the created instance.
        If no options are given, default options will be used.
        See listing~\ref{code:elq-ctor} of example usages of the \code{Elq} function.
        The function returns an object containing the core public \gls{API} methods of the \abbr{elq} instance.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example usages of the \code{Elq} function that creates \abbr{elq} instances.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-ctor}]]
          //Default options being used.
          var elq = new Elq();

          //A custom reporter and cycle detector being used.
          var customCycleDetector = ...;
          var customReporter = ...;
          var elq2 = new Elq({
            reporter: customReporter,
            cycleDetector: customCycleDetector
          });
        \end{lstlisting}

        The next step after that an instance has been created is to register the plugins to be used by the instance.
        There are two methods for handling plugins: \code{use} and \code{using}.
        The \code{use} method registers a plugin to be used by the library.
        It is responsible for controlling that plugins do not conflict with each other and that plugins are initiated correctly with the library instance.
        The method requires a \emph{plugin object} and accepts an optional options object parameter.
        When called, it will create a plugin instance and return it.
        A plugin object acts as a plugin definition and is responsible for describing a plugin and providing a function to create a plugin instance.
        The \code{using} method requires an \emph{plugin identifier} as parameter and tells if the given plugin is being used (has been reigstered) by the instance or not.
        A plugin identifier can either be the plugin object or the name of the plugin.
        See listing~\ref{code:plugin-object} for details about the plugin object and how it is used with the three methods for handling plugins.

        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Plugin object definition and examples of handling plugins.},captionpos=b,label={code:plugin-object}]]
          var myPlugin = {
            getName: function() {
              // Returns the name of the plugin, which has to be 
              // unique in an elq instance.
              return "my-plugin";
            },
            getVersion: function() {
              // Returns the version of the plugin.
              return "1.0.0";
            },
            isCompatible: function(elq) {
              // Returns a boolean that indicates if this plugin
              // is compatible with the given elq instance.
              return true;
            },
            make: function(elq, options) {
              // Returns a plugin instance. It is optional to use
              // the elq instance or options object in the initiation process.
              return {...};
            }
          };

          // Tell the elq instance to use myPlugin with default options.
          var myPluginInstance1 = elq.use(myPlugin);

          // Tell the elq2 instance to use myPlugin with custom options.
          var options = {...};
          var myPluginInstance2 = elq2.use(myPlugin, options);

          // The plugin instances are not equal since they have been initated to different elq instances.
          myPluginInstance1 !== myPluginInstance2 // -> true

          // Check if the plugin is being used.
          elq.using(myPlugin); // true

          // Also possible to check by the plugin name.
          elq.using("my-plugin"); // true

          // Plugins not being used by the instance returns false.
          elq.using("other-plugin"); // false
        \end{lstlisting}

        When the desired plugins have been registered to the \abbr{elq} instance, it is time to apply the library to the target \glspl{element} (i.e., the elements that will be queried for conditional styles).
        This is done with the \code{start} method which requires a collection of \glspl{element} as a parameter.
        When called, it will invoke all \code{start} methods on all registered plugins which gives them the opportunity to initiate the \glspl{element} according to their own mechanisms.
        To satisfy the requirements \ref{itm:natural} and \ref{itm:assumption} the function is agnostic about the \glspl{element} collection --- all objects that are iterable and contains \glspl{element} are accepted.
        It is also possible to provide a single \gls{element} without a collection.
        The effect of invoking the \code{start} method on an element multiple times is defined by the plugins.
        See listing~\ref{code:elq-start} for example usages of the \code{start} method.
        \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=10,caption={Example usages of the \code{start} method. The method only requires an iterable collection, so it is library agnostic.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-start}]]
          // Initiating the library to a single element.
          var singleElement = document.getElementById("...");
          elq.start(singleElement);

          // Initiating the library to multiple elements.
          var singleElement2 = document.getElementById("...");
          elq.start([singleElement, singleElement2]);

          // Initiating the library to multiple elements using
          // third-party libraries (in this case jQuery).
          var jqueryElementsCollection = $("...");
          elq.start(jqueryElementsCollection);
        \end{lstlisting}

      \subsection{Plugin API}\label{sec:plugin-api}
        The plugin \gls{API} is a superset of the public \gls{API}.
        Plugins have additional direct access to most core subsystems presented in section~\ref{sec:arcithecture}.
        The plugin \gls{API} access is given to a plugin when it is registered (i.e., when the \abbr{elq} instance invokes the \code{make} function of the plugin definition).
        Recall from subsection~\ref{sec:public-api} that the \code{make} function of the plugin definition is given two parameters at invokation; \code{elq} and \code{options}.
        The first parameter is a reference to the \abbr{ELQ} instance (to which the plugin was registered) extended with the plugin \gls{API}.
        Direct access is given to the following core subsystems:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Reporter}: via the \code{elq.reporter} property that refers to the reporter instance.
          \item \textbf{Cycle detector}: via the \code{elq.cycleDetector} property that refers to the cycle detector instance.
          \item \textbf{Batch processor}: via the \code{elq.BatchProcessor} property that refers to a factory function that creates \glslink{batch processing}{batch processor} instances.
          \item \textbf{\abbr{ID} handler}: via the \code{elq.idHandler} property that refers to the \abbr{ID} handler instance. \todo{Include id handler in section \ref{sec:arcithecture}?}
        \end{itemize}
        Direct access is not given to the plugin handler and element resize detector subsystems since their \glspl{API} are already exposed in the public \gls{API}.
        However, an additional method of the plugin handler system is exposed; the \code{getPlugin} method that returns the registered plugin instance given a plugin identifier parameter.
        This method is needed to enable interplugin communications.

        The reporter has three methods; \code{log}, \code{warn} and \code{error}.
        They are used to report information, warnings and errors respectively.
        The default behavior of the reporter is to report to the browser console if present.

        The cycle detector has a method \code{isUpdateCyclic} that tells if the desired state update of an element is part of a cycle.
        To do so, it requires two parameters; the element that the update should be applied to, and the state update itself.
        A third time parameter, that tells when the update was requested, is optional and will default to the time of the method call.

        Instead of having a single \glslink{batch processing}{batch processor} instance shared among all library entities (i.e., core subsystems and plugins), each entity has to create an own instance.
        This to avoid entities interfering with each other while performing \gls{batch processing}.
        For example, some entities might want to force the \glslink{batch processing}{batch} to process at a point where it would be beneficial for other entities to delay the \glslink{batch processing}{batch}.
        The \code{createBatchProcessor} accepts an optional options object parameter and returns a \glslink{batch processing}{batch processor} instance that has two methods; \code{add} and \code{force}.
        The \code{add} method requires a function parameter that will be called when the \glslink{batch processing}{batch} is processed.
        Since the \glslink{batch processing}{batch processor} is leveled, as motivated in section~\ref{}, the method also accepts an optional parameter that defines at which level the given function should be processed.
        The \code{force} method commence the processing of the \glslink{batch processing}{batch}, which can happen synchronously or asynchronously a the optional parameter.
        Two important options to the \code{createBatchProcessor} are the \code{async} and \code{auto} options.
        If the \code{async} option is enabled, the \glslink{batch processing}{batch} will be processed asynchronously as soon as possible after that the \code{force} method has been invoked.
        If the \code{auto} option is enabled, \code{force} will be invoked when the first function of the \glslink{batch processing}{batch} has been added (this implies that \code{async} has to be enabled).

        The \abbr{ID} handler has one method \code{get} that returns the \abbr{ID} of the required element parameter.
        If the element does not have any \abbr{ID} one will be assigned to the element.
        It is possible to override the assignment with an option parameter.

      \subsection{Plugins}
        \begin{metatext}
          So far, only prerequisites for third-party element queries has been presented.
          Now, it is time to describe the systems and \glspl{API} that will actually realize element queries as \abbr{elq} plugins.
          It should be noted that the plugins presented here is the suggested solution to element queries according to the research of this thesis.
          They are designed for good performance, good compatibility, and ease of use.
          For extreme requirements or corner cases, custom \abbr{elq} plugins might be preferred.
        \end{metatext}

        \abbr{elq} plugins may use custom element attributes to define rules and plugin options.
        The \gls{HTML} standard supports custom attributes prefixed with \code{data-}.
        Modern browsers usually permits to discard the \code{data-} prefix for custom attributes.
        For visual reasons, custom attributes will be written in the shortest possible way in this thesis (without the \code{data-} prefix).
        It should be noted that although not written in the examples, the library and all plugins support all combinations of custom attribute declarations so if desired, the library is able to conform to the \gls{HTML} standard.

        \subsubsection{Breakpoints}
          This is the plugin that observes element resizes and updates their size states according to predefined breakpoints.
          The name of the plugin is \code{elq-breakpoints} and it does not have any dependencies (other than the element resize detector of the \abbr{elq} core).
          The main idea of the plugin is to apply classes to target elements that reflects in which size state they are.
          Each element defines breakpoints to which the plugin will update the size state.
          The breakpoints of an element are defined by custom element attributes.
          See listing~\ref{code:elq-breakpoints-example} for an example of breakpoints definitions.
          \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=12,caption={Example an \gls{HTML} element that uses the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-breakpoints-example}]]
            <div id="target" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
            ...
            </div>
          \end{lstlisting}
          The \code{elq} attribute states that it is an \abbr{elq} element, and the \code{elq-breakpoints} attribute states that the element should be handled by the plugin.
          The \code{elq-breakpoints\-width="300 500"} tells the plugin that the element should have two width breakpoints at 300 and 500 pixels.
          Height breakpoints are defined in the same way with the \code{elq-breakpoints-height} attribute.
          The possible size states of the element would then be (in pixels):
          \begin{itemize}
            \item $width < 300$
            \item $300 <= width < 500$
            \item $500 <= width$
          \end{itemize}
          The plugin will append classes to the element that reflects the size state of the element.
          For each breakpoint, one class will be present that tells if the size is above or below the breakpoint.
          The number of size states of an element in a dimension is given by $n_{ss}(n_b) = n_b + 1$, where $n_b$ is the number of breakpoints in that dimension.
          The number of breakpoint classes of an element in a dimension is given by $n_{bc}(n_{b}) = 2n_b$.
          The number of breakpoint classes active at the same time for an element in a dimension is given by $n_{abc}(n_{b}) = n_{b}$.
          The format of the classes are \code{elq-[dimension]-[above|below]-[breakpoint]}.
          For example, if the example element is below 300 pixels wide, it will have the following two classes present:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \code{elq-width-below-300}
            \item \code{elq-width-below-500}
          \end{itemize}

          Breakpoint classes are utilized for applying conditional styles for elements based on the size state of the target element.
          See listing~\ref{code:elq-breakpoints-style} for conditional styles of the target element and it's children.
          \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=12,caption={Example of conditional styles using the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin classes},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-breakpoints-style}]]
            #target {
              color: black;
              font-size: 15px;
            }

            #target.elq-width-below-300   { font-size: 10px;  }
            #target.elq-width-above-300   { color: red;       }
            #target.elq-width-above-500   { font-size: 20px;  }
            #target.elq-width-above-500 p { padding: 10px;    }
            #target.elq-width-below-500 p { padding: 5px;     }
          \end{lstlisting}
          In this example it is shown that elements can be conditionally styled depending on their own sizes.
          Additionally, children can be styled by stating the target element size state as the left-most selector.
          In the example, all paragraph elements \code{p} will be styled conditionally depending on the target element size state.

        \subsubsection{Mirror}
          This plugin is needed as an addition to the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin in some cases due to limitations of CSS.
          As of the \gls{CSS3} specification, there is no way to select ancestor elements of an element.
          For instance, \code{p img} is a selector that matches all image elements that are contained by a paragraph.
          However, it is not possible to construct a selector that matches all paragraphs that contains images.
          The \code{elq-mirror} plugin overcome these limitations by mirroring the breakpoint classes of an \code{elq-breakpoints} element.
          Suppose that it is desired for an application to style all paragraph elements differently by the size of the nearest element with a \code{container} class.
          Paragraphs may appear nested in other elements, that may be generated dynamically at runtime.
          Therefore, the structure of the application is not known when writing the style code, so no assumptions can be done about the markup structure.
          Consider the example markup given in listing~\ref{code:elq-mirror-example} for an example markup structure.
          It should be noted that the \code{container} elements may be styled in any way (e.g., the widths of the inner container elements could be relative to the outer container element).
          \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=12,caption={Example markup structure where all paragraphs are desired to be conditionally styled by the nearest ancestor container.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-mirror-example}]
            <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
              <div>
                <p>Paragraph 1</p>
              </div>

              <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
                <p>Paragraph 2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
                <p>Paragraph 3</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          \end{lstlisting}
          A naive approach to applying conditional styles for the paragraph elements would be using the selector structure given in listing~\ref{code:elq-mirror-example-cont}.
          \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=12,caption={A naive approach to styling the paragraphs conditionally.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-mirror-example-cont}]
            .container p                      { background-color: red;    }
            .container.elq-width-above-300 p  { background-color: yellow; }
            .container.elq-width-above-500 p  { background-color: green;  }
          \end{lstlisting}
          The problem with this is that the selectors states that all paragraphs that are children of \emph{any} container should be styled in some way.
          So if the outer container element is 600 pixels wide and the inner containers are 200 pixels wide, all paragraphs would be colored green.
          In this particular case, the desired behavior is that the first paragraph is colored green and the two inner paragraphs colored red.
          By using the \code{elq-mirror} plugin, the correct behavior can be achieved.
          Elements are initiated to mirror elements by adding attributes in the same way like with the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin.
          The mirror elements will then match the \code{elq-breakpoints} classes of the nearest ancestor that has the \code{elq-breakpoints} attribute.
          See listing~\ref{code:elq-mirror-example-cont-2} for how the plugin can be used to achieve the desired behavior of the conditionally styled paragraphs.
          % If no such ancestor is found, the document root will be mirrored instead. //TODO: Have this?
          \begin{lstlisting}[gobble=12,caption={By using the \code{elq-mirror} plugin to overcome the limitations of CSS, the correct behavior can be achieved of the conditionally styled paragraphs.},captionpos=b,label={code:elq-mirror-example-cont-2}]
            /* HTML */
            <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
              <div>
                <p elq elq-mirror>Paragraph 1</p>
              </div>

              <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
                <p elq elq-mirror>Paragraph 2</p>
              </div>
              <div class="container" elq elq-breakpoints elq-breakpoints-width="300 500">
                <p elq elq-mirror>Paragraph 3</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            /* CSS */
            .container p                      { background-color: red;    }
            .container p.elq-width-above-300  { background-color: yellow; }
            .container p.elq-width-above-500  { background-color: green;  }
          \end{lstlisting}
          Notice that the breakpoint classes now are used in conjunction with the paragraphs instead of the containers in the CSS selectors.
          Now, the conditional styles will be applied to all paragraphs that are children of containers; with the size criterion being relative to the nearest ancestor container.

          By mirroring an element's breakpoint classes, elements can be styled by criterion of any element (ancestor, sibling, child, etc.).
          The plugin is at the moment restricted to the nearest ancestor \code{elq-breakpoint} element, but could easily be extended to support more advanced mirror constellations.

    \section{Element resize detection}\label{sec:imp_erd}
      \begin{metatext}
        As described in section~\ref{sec:arcithecture}, \abbr{elq} needs a subsystem that is able to detect when elements change size.
        As the element resize detection system is a core subsystem of \abbr{elq}, and extensively used by the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin, it is important to find a both stable and performant approach to detect element size changes.
        This section is mainly based on \normalfont{\cite{backalley,eq_imp_css-element-queries}}.
      \end{metatext}
        \todo{Explain target element}

        Unfortunately, there is no standardized resize event for arbitrary \glspl{element}.
        Only frames (\glspl{element} that render it's content independently of the container \gls{element}, such as \code{iframe} and \code{object}) support the resize event by standard since they have their own \gls{viewport}.
        Legacy versions of Internet Explorer (version 8 and down, but also some later versions depending on the \gls{document} mode and if the \gls{browser} is in quirks mode) do support the resize event on arbitrary \glspl{element}.
        Since the library needs to support commonly used \gls{HTML} \glspl{element}, a solution to observe resize events of any \gls{element} is desired.
        According to the common use case, a valid limitation is to only support element resize detection for non-void elements (i.e., elements that can contain content).
        \todo{Write more about void elements, that they can easily be wrapped with other elements to achieve the desired element query effect?}
        Possible solutions are:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item\label{itm:erd-approach-polling} \textbf{Polling}:
            To have a script running asynchronously to check all \glspl{element} if they have resized.
            This can be achieved by using the \gls{JavaScript} \code{setInterval}\footnote{See \url{http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/webappapis.html\#timers} for more information about \gls{JavaScript} timer functions.} function.
            Short polling intervals (high frequency) would lead to being able to detect resize changes quicker but having worse performance.
            Longer polling intervals (low frequency) would not be able to detect changes as quickly but increases the performance.
            The longest possible delay between an actual resize event and the polling detecting is given by the polling interval time.
            This approach is the most robust, as it supports all elements (including void elements) and provides excellent browser compatibility.
          \item\label{itm:erd-approach-frame} \textbf{Injecting frames}:
            Since frame \glspl{element} are the only ones that support resize events \glslink{native}{natively}, the idea is to inject frame \glspl{element} as children to the target \glspl{element}..
            By styling the frame so that it depends on the target \gls{element} and set the size to be 100 percent, the frame will always be the same size as the target element.
            Then a resize event handler can be attached to the frame that emits a resize event for every target \gls{element} resize.
            So in order to observe resize events of an element, a frame \gls{element} is injected and observed instead.
          \item\label{itm:erd-approach-scroll} \textbf{Injecting overflowing \glspl{element}}:
            Similar to the frames approach, an \gls{element} is injected to the target element that emit events, which can be observed in JavaScript, when the target element is resized.
            Multiple overflowing elements are configured, and injcected as children, so that they emit scroll events\footnote{See \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/\#event-type-scroll} for more information about the scroll event.} when the target element resize.
            For detecting when the target \gls{element} shrinks, two \glspl{element} are needed; one for handling the scrollbars and one for triggering them.
            Similarly, for detecting when the target \gls{element} expands, two \gls{element} are needed in the same way.
            A container \gls{element} is injected, to contain the four \glspl{element} and make sure that they match the size of the target element.
        \end{enumerate}
        Solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-polling} is appealing because it does not mutate the \gls{DOM}, supports all elements (including void elements), and it provides excellent \gls{browser} compatibility since it does not rely on special \gls{element} behaviors or similar.
        However, in order to prevent the \gls{responsive} \glspl{element} lagging behind the size changes of the user interface, the polls need to be performed quite frequently.
        Recall from section~\ref{sec:layout-process} that \glspl{layout engine} typically have a layout queue in order to perform layout in \glslink{batch processing}{batches} for increased performance.
        Each poll would force the layout queue to be flushed since the computed style of \glspl{element} needs to be retrieved in order to know if \glspl{element} have resized or not.
        Also, since the polling is performed all the time, the overall page performance will be decreased even if the page is idle which is undesired especially for devices running on battery.
        \todo{Should make quick test to see how much CPU it uses when polling frequently}

        Solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-frame} and \ref{itm:erd-approach-scroll} have similar characteristics.
        Both solutions mutate the \gls{DOM} and relies on special \gls{element} behavior, but they offer many advantages over polling.
        Since they are event based, layout engines only need to perform extra work when installing the solution to the target \glspl{element} and when the target \glspl{element} actually resize.
        Event based resize detection also implies minimal delay between the actual resize event and the detection.
        By positioning the injected elements \code{absolute} with width and height set to \code{100\%}, the injected \glspl{element} do not affect the visual representation of the \gls{document}.
        However, injecting elements into the target \glspl{element} has some implications:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{\gls{CSS} selectors may break}:
            Since target \glspl{element} get an extra child, \gls{CSS} selectors may behave differently.
            For instance, the selector \code{\#target *} selector also matches the injected \glspl{element} which may result in the injected element being styled in a way that it will be visible or in other ways interfere with the original user interface.
            Especially solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-scroll} is sensitive to unintentional styles being applied, as the injected elements are finely styled and tuned in order to behave as desired.
            Additionally, selectors such as \code{:first-child} and \code{:last-child} will behave differently since the target element have an additional child injected.
          \item \textbf{\gls{JavaScript} may break}:
            Similar to with the \gls{CSS} selectors, \gls{JavaScript} \gls{DOM} selectors may break.
            The first node (or last) of the target \gls{element} may not be what developers expect it to be, since an \gls{element} has been injected.
            Also, code that alter the content of \glspl{element} (such as \code{element.InnerHTML = ...}) may undesirably remove the injected \gls{element} of the target element.
          \item \textbf{The target \gls{element} must be positioned}:
            \todo{Recall from where? This have not been described.}
            Recall that absolute positioned \glspl{element} are moved up to the first non-static positioned ancestor.
            Since the injected element must be a child of the target \gls{element} (and not moved upwards in the layout tree), the target \gls{element} cannot be positioned \code{static} that is the default positioning for many \glspl{element}.
            Fortunately, \glspl{element} positioned \code{relative} behave exactly like \code{static}, given that the \glspl{element} do not have any styles applicable to relative elements (such as \code{top} or \code{bottom}).
            Since the style properties that depend on the \gls{element} being \code{relative} positioned do not affect the \gls{element} if it is \code{static} positioned, the properties can be removed or regarded as developer errors.
            This way the target \gls{element} can be changed to \code{relative} positioning with the special style properties removed, to obtain the same visual representation as being positioned \code{static}.
        \end{itemize}

        For solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-frame}, it has been shown by \cite{backalley} that \code{object} is the most suitable frame \gls{element} to be used for this purpose as they have good \gls{browser} compatibility and adequate performance.
        One disadvantage with this solution is that installing \code{object} elements is quite a heavy task.
        See figure~\ref{fig:erd-original-object} for graphs that show the performance of the object-based element resize detector provided by \cite{backalley}.
        As shown by the graphs, the object solution can be installed with adequate performance as long as the number of elements is low.
        The solution does not scale well as the number of element increases.

        Before the newer object solution was presented, the scroll-based solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-scroll} was described by \cite{backalley}.
        However as the object solution was discovered, solution \ref{itm:erd-approach-scroll} was rejected in favor of the new solution.
        Fortunately, a somewhat reworked version of the scroll-based solution is still available \cite{eq_imp_css-element-queries}.
        See figure~\ref{fig:erd-original-scroll} for graphs that show how the scroll-based solution performs compared to the object-based solution.
        It is clear that the scroll-based solution both performs and scales better than the object-based solution.
        The memory footprint is reduced significantly, which improves the performance further.
        The amount of memory used by the scroll-based solution is so low that reliable measurements could not be gathered, as the number of elements was not high enough to affect the memory usage.

        Due to problems such as layout thrashing, bugs and an undesired \gls{API}; the scroll-based solution provided \cite{eq_imp_css-element-queries} was completely rewritten to better fit \abbr{elq}.
        Layout thrashing was avoided by using the leveled batch processor described in section~\ref{sec:plugin-api}.
        \todo{Describe the leveled batch processor in detail somewhere?}
        \todo{Describe how stuff was batch processed in detail?}
        See figure~\ref{fig:erd-elq-scroll} for graphs that show how the \abbr{elq} scroll-based solution performs compared to the other solutions.
        As evident in the graph, the optimized \abbr{elq} solution has significantly reduced installation times compared to the other two.
        The \abbr{elq} solution also scales better, as more clearly shown in figure~\ref{fig:erd-solutions-regressed} that includes polynomial regression graphs for all three solutions.
        Both scroll-based solutions have the same memory footprint (i.e., too low for reliable measurements).

    \section{Detecting runtime cycles}\label{sec:imp_cycle_detector}
      \begin{metatext}
        As described in section~\ref{sec:arcithecture}, \abbr{elq} needs a subsystem that is able to detect cyclic element style state updates, in order to warn about or prevent cyclic rules.
        As the cycle detection system is a core subsystem of \abbr{elq}, and extensively used by the \code{elq-breakpoints} plugin, it is important to find a both stable and performant approach to detect cyclic updates.
      \end{metatext}

      Recall from Section~\ref{sec:plugin-api} that the cycle detection subsystem has a function \code{isUpdateCyclic} that is to tell if the desired update is part of a cycle or not.
      Further, recall from Section~\ref{sec:cyclic-rules} that cycles may depend on multiple factors (e.g., content, browser behavior, \gls{CSS}, \gls{JavaScript}).
      Since a cycle graph can be both spread over different factors and chained; a simplistic approach to detecting cycles has been taken.
      Recall that the \code{isUpdateCyclic} function requires an element $e$ parameter and state $s$ parameter.
      For each element $e$, an chronologically ordered list of states $L_{states}$ is kept.
      For each call of \code{isUpdateCyclic}, the following cycle detection algorithm is performed:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Construct $L_{states}$ if needed.
        \item Constuct an update tuple $u$ that consists of the current time $t$ and the new state $s$.
        \item Set the cycle counter $c$ to zero.
        \item Iterate $L_{states}$ from beginning to end (starting with the most recent update tuple).
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item\label{itm:cycle-detection-step-loop}
            If the time $t_i$ (of the current update tuple $u_i$ of $L_{states}$) and $t$ differs more than a predefined constant $T$, then $u_i$ is regarded as too old to consider.
            Since $L_{states}$ is chronologically ordered all update tuples after $u_i$ must also be too old.
            Therefore, all tuples from (and including) $u_i$ are removed from $L_{states}$. Next step is \ref{itm:cycle-detection-step-prepend-tuple}.
          \item If the state $s_i$ (of the current update tuple $u_i$ of $L_{states}$) and $s$ are equal, then increment the cycle counter $c$.
          \item If $c$ is greater than a predefined constant $C$, then a cycle has been detected. The function should then \textbf{return true}.
          \item The next update tuple in the list is considered. Next step is \ref{itm:cycle-detection-step-loop}.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item\label{itm:cycle-detection-step-prepend-tuple} Prepend $u$ to $L_{states}$ (i.e., $u$ will be the most recent element in the list).
        \item No cycle has been detected, and therefore the function should \textbf{return false}.
      \end{enumerate}

    \todo[inline]{Write about media query CSS approach as an approach?}

    There are numerous implementations of third-party element query libraries. This chapter will list and analyze them.
    Since many of them share the same characteristics, they will be classified and each class will be analyzed as a group.
    Identified element query third-party libraries that directly or indirectly enables element queries are the ones presented in table~\ref{table:approaches-classifications}.
    They can be divided into the following classes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Valid syntax}: Approaches that conforms to the \gls{CSS}, \gls{HTML}, and \gls{JavaScript} standards.
      \item \textbf{Invalid syntax}: Approaches that requires custom (invalid) syntax or in any other way do not conform to the standards described above.
      \item \textbf{Static}: Approaches that in a compilation step calculates desired element queries and transforms them into valid \gls{CSS} with an element query runtime or media queries. These approaches do not support layout changes at runtime.
      \item \textbf{Dynamic}: Approaches that handles element queries at runtime (and therefore support pages that changes dynamically).
      \item \textbf{Automatic}: Approaches that updates affected element queries on viewport and element resize events automatically.
      \item \textbf{Semi-automatic}: Approaches that partly updates affected element queries. Usually only viewport resize events are handled automatically.
    \end{itemize}
    It should be noted that most of the current approaches are combinations of different classes.
    See table~\ref{table:approaches-classifications} for a classification of current approaches.
    \todo{Not really happy with the dynamic vs static. Need to define this exactly. Is it dynamic because CSS is parsed at runtime or does it need a way to rerun the library on new elements as well?}

    The approaches \cite{eq_imp_magichtml,eq_imp_eqcss,eq_imp_prollyfill-min-width,eq_imp_localised-css,eq_imp_gss} have in common that they require developers to write cunstom (invalid) \gls{CSS}.
    Since they do no longer conform the \gls{CSS} specification, there are no longer any limitations to what can be done with \gls{CSS}.
    As shown by \cite{eq_imp_eqcss,eq_imp_gss} quite advanced features can be implemented this way.
    Additionally, teaching \gls{CSS} new tricks implies that it is possible to implement an solution to element queries that does not require any changes to the \gls{HTML}, which can be preferable since all styling then can be written in \gls{CSS} (which is the purpose of \gls{CSS}).
    However, there are numerous flaws to the approaches that requires invalid \gls{CSS}.
    First, it requires a compilation step in order to produce valid \gls{CSS} that layout engines understand.
    This can either be done at server side or in the browser at runtime.
    The advantage of having the compilation step at server side is increased performance since the browser will understand the \gls{CSS} directly.
    However, having compiled the \gls{CSS} at server side the the layout of the page cannot be changed at runtime.
    By instead having the compilations step at runtime, dynamic layouts are possible.
    The performance impact of having the compilation step at runtime can be significant for the following reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The received \gls{CSS} cannot be understood by the browser, and therefore all parsing and reasoning about it has to be postponed until the library script executes.
      Note that the layout engines could in theory parse the \gls{CSS} and perform speculative selector matching while waiting for other parts of the page to finish (such as executing scripts), which cannot be done with invalid \gls{CSS}.
      \item When the library script executes, it has to parse the custom \gls{CSS}, a process which is most likely slower than native parsing.
      \item When parsed, the library needs to apply it's logic to the parsed \gls{CSS} and produce valid \gls{CSS}. The produced \gls{CSS} needs to be applied to the document by mutating the \gls{DOM}.
      \todo{Write about reentrant HTML and layout thrashing etc?}
      \item The layout engine will need to parse the \gls{CSS} added to the \gls{DOM}, which means that the styles of the page has been parsed twice.
      \item The custom parser engine will need to be included in the page, which implies a bigger library script size.
    \end{itemize}
    Additional problems with custom \gls{CSS}, that also applies to custom \gls{CSS} compiled at server side, are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 
        By not conforming to \gls{CSS} standards many tools such as preprocessors, validators and linters will no longer be compatible.
        Also, editors and other code-displaying tools will not be able to understand the syntax and will therefore not be able to highlight the code properly.
        It should be noted that it is in some cases possible to create plugins or similar to such tools to extend their capabilities.
      \item The \gls{API} and parser will need to be kept up to date with \gls{CSS} standards in order to make sure new features of \gls{CSS} are supported and that they are not conflicting with the custom \gls{API}.
      \item \todo[inline]{Write that scripts are not allowed to access content of CSS server from another domain than the script?}
      \item
        \todo[inline]{Problems with documentation, resources and tutorials since the syntax is custom?}
    \end{itemize}

      \section{Layout engine market share statistics}\label{sec:layout_engines_market_share}
        Browser market share was retrieved by \emph{StatCounter}\footnote{StatCounter graph \url{http://gs.statcounter.com/\#all-browser-ww-monthly-201402-201502-bar}}.
        Since the graph only display \gls{browser} market share and not \gls{layout engine}, it is needed to further divide the \glspl{browser} into \gls{layout engine} percentages.
        The Blink engine was introduced with Chrome version 28 and Android version 4.4 \cite{wiki_blink}.
        Since Chrome has very good adoption rate\footnote{According to \url{http://clicky.com/marketshare/global/web-browsers/google-chrome/}} of new versions the Chrome market share percentage of 39.72\% is considered to be Blink based.
        However, Android has not as good adoption rate as Chrome with only 44.2\% using Android version 4.4 and up\footnote{According to \url{https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html}}.
        Android has a \gls{browser} market share of 7.21\%. 44.2\% of the 7.21\% Android \glspl{browser} is assumed to be Blink based and 55.8\% to be \gls{WebKit} based (since the Android \gls{browser} was \gls{WebKit} based before Blink).
        Of course, the assumption that users with old versions of Android browse the {\gls{web} as much as users with new versions are probably invalid, but the data source itself is uncertain enough to make such assumptions and the percentages should only be regarded as guidelines.
        Opera with the lowest market share at 3.97\% started using the Blink engine in late 2013 as of version 15.
        StatCounter shows that 37\% of the Opera users are using Opera Mini (their mobile \gls{browser}), which does not use the Blink engine (it uses Opera's own Presto \gls{layout engine} which will be ignored).
        All desktop users of Opera are assumed to be using version 15 or above and hence using the Blink engine.
        The total market share percentage of the Blink engine is then calculated to $39.72 + 0.442\cdot7.21 + 0.37\cdot3.97 = 44.38\%$.
        Safari, with the market share percentage of 7.46\%, has always been \gls{WebKit} based.
        iOS also uses \gls{WebKit} and has the market share percentage of 6.16\%.
        The \gls{WebKit} market share percentage is calculated to $7.46 + 0.558\cdot7.21 + 6.16 = 17.64\%$.
        FireFox, with the market share percentage of 12.83\%, has always been Gecko based and is the only major \gls{browser} that uses the Gecko engine.
        The market share percentage of Gecko is therefore 12.83\%.
        Internet Explorer, with the market share percentage of 14.96\%, has been Trident based since version 4.
        Since Internet Explorer 4 is no longer in use\footnote{According to \url{http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp}}, the market share percentage of the Trident engine is 14.96\%.
      \section{Usage share of browser versions}
        \todo{Put this somewhere else?}
        For compatability, the library needs to support older \glspl{browser}.
        Most of the end users are using a self updating \gls{browser} (those \glspl{browser} are usually referred to as the \emph{evergreen} \glspl{browser}), which improves the adoption rate of new versions greatly.
        See figure~\todo{Have a figure or not? If yes, then reference it here.} for the adoption rate of new versions of Chrome for an example of how evergreen \glspl{browser} keep their users updated.
        Unfortunately, there are some laggards that still use very outdated versions of some \glspl{browser}.
        Each version of Internet Explorer 8 up to 11 need to be supported since they all still have a significant user share.
        Opera version 12 does also have
